Players are swinging faster than ever, leading to longer drives and improved scoring potential.

This has been especially prevalent on the PGA TOUR where average clubhead speed is up over 3.5 mph in the last decade, from 112.9 mph to 116.5 mph. At last week’s PGA Championship, the 74 players who made the cut averaged an impressive 117.9 mph CHS.

However, compared to their male peers, players on the LPGA Tour have always seemed to favor accuracy over speed.

LPGA Tour players hit an incredible percentage of their fairways. Too many, perhaps.

There are 12 women on the LPGA Tour averaging an astounding 80% or greater fairways hit. By comparison, Aaron Rai is the leader in driving accuracy on the PGA TOUR at 73%, with just four other men at 70% or higher.

Driving accuracy can be a messy statistic. A golfer could miss a fairway by a foot or blow their tee shot OB, but both shots count as a missed fairway. Also, because it doesn't consider distance, not all fairways hit are equal in terms of their impact on scoring potential. Stokes Gained: Off-The-Tee, however, is much more representative of driving performance.

When considering the BEST (not just most accuracte) drivers on the LPGA, elite distance seems to be more important than elite accuracy. Of the top 10 in SG:OTT on the LPGA Tour, only three have a driving accuracy above 70% (which ranks 92nd on the LPGA Tour). However, of those 10, all are in the top 42 in average driving distance.

It seems as if many LPGA players could benefit from sacrificing some accuracy for more distance.

This was a conclusion from our session with Gaby Lopez.

When she came to TPI last winter with her coach, Horacio Morales, and trainer, Janet Alexander, she said she had three driver speeds: fairway finder, faster and fastest (she called it her ""King Kong""). She liked swinging all out (King Kong), but felt like her mechanics were inefficient. The data confirmed it.

When Greg looked at her King Kong swing, he loved the intent, but saw that her ground reaction forces could be optimized to help improve her ability to transfer force to the club.

Gabby‘s lower body is a rocket ship. She has tremendous physical ability. It shows up in the gym, in our power testing (22” countermovement jump) and on our force plates (over 220% bodyweight vertical force with her driver).

That said, after looking at her kinetics, it was clear she was generating her forces too late. This is one of the key lessons we focus on in our advanced Power and Golf Certification courses. Timing of force can be just as important as magnitude. If you’re too late, you don’t have opportunity to transfer the energy to the club.

One of the hallmarks of elite ball strikers is that they tend to generate ground reaction forces much earlier than higher handicappers.

By teaching Gaby to push against the ground earlier in the downswing, she developed more efficient mechanics, both in terms of power and consistency.

Gaby’s driver has always been a strength, but in 2025 it’s become a weapon.

Consider this progression:

In 2023, Gaby ranked 49th on the LPGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee (0.19 per round), averaging 262 yards and finding 71% of the fairways.

In 2024, Gaby rose to 28th in SG:OTT (0.41 per round), averaging 264 yards and finding 75% of the fairways.

In 2025, Gaby is sitting at 4th in SG:OTT (0.79), averaging a career-best 277 yards with 68% accuracy.

Essentially, by adding 13 yards and only losing 7% accuracy, it means that Gaby is one club closer off-the-tee 14 times per round while only missing one more fairway per round. Obviously, this is a tremendous statistical advantage.

This more evidence that speed is a skill. It is trainable, but requires intention and attention.

If we don’t practice top speed, how can we expect to control top speed? As Greg says in the video, it’s tough to survive in the jungle if you were raised in the zoo.

Our assessment with 2019 RSM Classic champion, Tyler Duncan, featured one of the most common Body-Swing Connections we see in golf.

Tyler came in with his trainer, Mike Chistman of Fit Garage Indianapolis, and his coach, Andrew Johnson. After taking Tyler through our physical screen, we noticed he had difficulty rotating in the backswing due to limited hip and thoracic spine mobility (identified through our Lower Quarter Rotation and Seated Trunk Rotation tests). In order to get the club to the top, Tyler compensates by leaning his spine towards the target, a swing characteristic we call Reverse Spine Angle.

Instead of turning, he tilts. As Greg says in the video, it's like a ""fake turn.""

Not only can Reverse Spine Angle create excessive stress on the lower back, it was causing attack angle and spin loft issues.

Tyler complained of difficulty controlling spin with his wedges. There are only two things that create spin: clubhead speed and spin loft. Spin loft is a product of dynamic loft and attack angle. Here's a quick explainer video from our online Golf Level 2 course:

Since Tyler was tilting his spine towards the target, his angle of attack was more negative, creating excessive spin loft.

Towards the end of the video, you'll see Greg trying to teach him to rotate into his backswing. The movement pattern felt unnatural to Tyler, in part, because of physical restrictions in his thoracic spine.

As Greg said, he made a mistake that rookie coaches commonly do. He was asking a player to do something he could not physically do.

As with every assessment at TPI, Tyler's Body-Swing Connection told a story. The movement patterns in his swing were developed around his physical limitations. Without performing a ten minute movement screen to better understand his movement capabilities, we'd have no idea if our recommendations would complement what he could physically do.

Assess, don't guess.

Chiara Noja is one of the most exciting young golfers in the women’s game. A teenage phenom, she became the youngest ever champion on the Ladies European Tour after winning the Aramco Team Series - Jeddah at just 16 years old.

Chiara came to us last year while recovering from a shoulder injury. Whenever we’re working with a golfer who is dealing with an injury, our first priority is to identify whether the swing could be part of the problem.

Due to the highly repetitive nature of golf, injuries are often the product of an accumulation of stress. We can’t eliminate the risk of injury, but we can work to eliminate excessive stress.

One of the goals of our advanced Medical courses is to help rehab professionals understand common injury-inducing mechanisms in the swing. In our experience, swing characteristics that limit the contribution of a body part tend be more demanding of other areas, often resulting in breakdown. After all, what does the work is what tends to hurt.

With three top-25 finishes in his last five starts, Jeremy Paul is finding his form in his rookie season on the PGA TOUR.

When Jeremy came to TPI for an assessment last fall, data from our physical screen and force plates not only revealed opportunities to improve distance potential, but identified one of the most common misconceptions we see in short game technique.

Physical Assessment Insights

One of the benefits of assessing golfers is it often reveals potential gaps in their physical training. When we physically screened Jeremy, we found a few limitations in mobility as well as a reduction in power, despite demonstrating above-average strength.

We don't view this as a concern, we see it as an opportunity.

Of the thousands of elite golfers we put through our Level 1 screen, only a handful have passed every test. The screen isn’t predictive of skill, but an evaluation of movement capabilities. Failing a screen doesn’t mean they can’t play great golf, it just suggests where they might need to focus in the gym or how their coach might want to consider adapting their swing to complement their movement.

When done properly, strength training should actually improve mobility. As Dr. Rose mentions in the video, Olympic weightlifters are not only some of the most powerful athletes in the world, but also some of the most mobile. Additionally, because strength was up and power was down, Jeremy might want to consider adding more ballistic exercises to his routine or reducing weight and reps in favor of greater velocity. Developing power requires intent. To paraphrase Dr. Andy Galpin in our Power Level 2 online course, exercises will not improve power unless they are performed powerfully. ""Exercises themselves don't determine adaptation."" ""Exercises themselves don't determine adaptation.”

If the PGA TOUR’s Creator Classic was any indication, golf’s YouTube era has officially arrived. According to the Sports Business Journal, Golf YouTube is responsible for BILLIONS of views on the platform every year. One of the most popular players on the platform who didn’t tee it up this week is Micah Morris.

With over 500,000 subscribers and approaching 100 million views on his channel, Micah is not only one of the most talented creators in golf, he's one of the most talented players as well.

Micah recently came to TPI for a full assessment which revealed one of the most commons Body-Swing Connections we see in golf.

Micah’s Body-Swing Connection

Micah was fighting the dreaded two-way miss with his driver, complaining of “difficulty getting to his lead side.” When we screened him and evaluated his swing mechanics, we identified a very clear Body-Swing Connection.

Micah is a terrific athlete and performed extremely well on our screen. However, when we tested his ability to internally rotate with our Lower Quarter Rotation test, we found a significant limitation. He did not like to turn into his lead side. Instead of rotating into his lead leg, he preferred to thrust towards the target line. The dreaded early extension.

Below is a screen capture of the Pelvis Position graphs from Micah's 3D data. The green line represents thrust, or the pelvis moving towards and away from the target line.

When the green line goes positive, the pelvis is moving towards the target line. At impact, Micah has moved forward over 2.5 inches, representing early extension.

As with any golfer we meet, our first goal is to determine whether a swing characteristic is the product of technique, or if it could be influenced by their physical capabilities.

In Micah's case, there's a high likelihood that his early extension and inability to move to the lead side were related to his limited internal rotation on his left side. Greg and Dave explain:

Potential Swing Fix

Whenever we identify a potential Body-Swing Connection, we give a golfer two choices: 1) adopt a routine to address their physical limitations in the gym, and/or 2) explore technical changes that will make it easier for them to work around their physical limitations.

As Greg and Dave demonstrate in the video below, simple set up changes are some of the least invasive and most effective strategies for working around limited internal rotation.

Micah said it in the video: ""I look at my swing a lot, I’ve just never looked at my body.""

He’s young, he’s fit and he’s mega-athletic but that doesn’t mean there aren’t potential physical issues that are inhibiting his swing. By identifying those physical issues, we not only help explain why he struggles to get to his lead side, we outline a path to improvement through work in the gym and on the range.",[],,www.mytpi.com,"Micah Morris Analyzing the Body-Swing Connection of the YouTube Star If the PGA TOURs Creator Classic was any indication, golfs YouTube era has officially arrived.

When we screened him and evaluated his swing mechanics, we identified a very clear Body-Swing Connection. Micah is a terrific athlete and performed extremely well on our screen. However, when we tested his ability to internally rotate with our Lower Quarter Rotation test, we found a significant limitation. He did not like to turn into his lead side. Instead of rotating into his lead leg, he preferred to thrust towards the target line. The dreaded early extension. Below is a screen capture of the Pelvis Position graphs from Micahs 3D data. The green line represents thrust, or the pelvis moving towards and away from the target line. When the green line goes positive, the pelvis is moving towards the target line. At impact, Micah has moved forward over 2.5 inches, representing early extension. As with any golfer we meet, our first goal is to determine whether a swing characteristic is the product of technique, or if it could be influenced by their physical capabilities. In Micahs case, theres a high likelihood that his early extension and inability to move to the lead side were related to his limited internal rotation on his left side. Greg and Dave explain Potential Swing Fix Whenever we identify a potential Body-Swing Connection, we give a golfer two choices 1 adopt a routine to address their physical limitations in the gym, andor 2 explore technical changes that will make it easier for them to work around their physical limitations. As Greg and Dave demonstrate in the video below, simple set up changes are some of the least invasive and most effective strategies for working around limited internal rotation. Micah said it in the video I look at my swing a lot, Ive just never looked at my body. Hes young, hes fit and hes mega-athletic but that doesnt mean there arent potential physical issues that are inhibiting his swing. By identifying those physical issues, we not only help explain why he struggles to get to his lead side, we outline a path to improvement through work in the gym and on the range.","['Micah Morris Analyzing the Body-Swing Connection of the YouTube Star If the PGA TOURs Creator Classic was any indication, golfs YouTube era has officially arrived.

13-year-old Ananyaa Sood of Dubai is among the most-skilled young golfers we’ve evaluated in the last few years. Her coordination, speed and maturity bely her age and her tournament results reflect it:

The week after visiting TPI, she finished 2nd at the US Kids Championship in the 13-year old division and the following month she won the inaugural Tommy Fleetwood International Pathway Series event.

While Ananyaa has the benefit of working with a world-class team, including her coach, Sujjan Singh, and trainer, Allister Parlane, we felt like there are several lessons that junior golf parents, coaches and trainers can take from our experience with her.

Don’t Wait to Evaluate

Our system is sport specific, not age specific. We don’t wait until a golfer is an adult to evaluate what they can do physically. In fact, in many cases, it makes more sense to evaluate a teenager. Kids develop at different rates. Chronological age is often not the same as biological age in young athletes (this concept is the foundation behind the skill and movement-based developmental criteria that we introduce in our advanced Junior courses).

Golf is a game of skill. The golf ball doesn’t care how much hip mobility you have, it only responds to the force applied by the club during impact. That said, the earlier we can help a golfer develop robust movement skills or identify potential limitations, the better opportunity they will have to develop a more repeatable and powerful pattern.

Ananyaa is already developing strength and movement skills in the weightroom under the supervision of an elite team, but, if she wants to play professionally, she still has work to do to match the physical capacity of her future competition.

Caution around the weight room is a common - and understandble - concern of parents of young golfers, however, the vast majority of juniors we meet have waited too long to begin training.

A golfer’s body is the 15th club in their bag. Why would we want to wait to develop it or to determine if it is limiting their ability to express a skill?

Don’t Let Competition Get in the Way of Development

We love to see junior golfers playing competitively. As coaches or parents, our first goal with junior golfers should be to help them develop a passion for the game, and playing golf - including tournament golf - is much more addicting than beating balls on a range.

That said, we believe that competition results should never take priority over a young golfer’s athletic and skill development.

If a golfer (or their parent or coach) feels they have limited resources to practice or train (whether time, money or energy) because of a busy tournament schedule, it’s a losing strategy. Short-term results should never supersede long-term goals.

As Greg said at the end of the video:

“When you meet someone with your golf skills who can hit it 100 yards past you, how are you going to feel? Trouble.”

Competitive rounds are valuable tools for developing a passion and highlighting learning opportunities, but should not be prioritized at the expense of physical or technical development.

Too Long, Too Heavy, Too Soon

In our evaluation with Ananyaa, we hypothesized that the weight of her clubs could be contributing to the compensations we saw in her swing, specifically loss of posture. Her coach, Sujjan, mentioned her mechanics improved when she tried lighter clubs. Though any adjustment with Ananyaa's fitting would be subtle, this feedback underscores an important potential pitfall in junior golf.

Some of the most common and egregious fitting mistakes we see are with parents setting up their young golfers. Too long, too heavy, too soon.

Gifting your kid your old driver can be a disaster for their game.



Junior golfer who swing clubs that are too long or too heavy can often develop poor mechanics and even increase risk of injury.

Golfers come in all shapes and sizes, but South Africa’s rising star, Christo Lamprecht, is a definitely outlier. At 6’8”, he’s not only one of the tallest professional golfers in the world, he’s also one of the fastest.

With mid-190’s ball speed (and a ceiling of ~210 mph), Christo is already one of the premier athletes in golf and his blend of tremendous physical gifts, unique mechanics and elite power make him a fascinating case study.

Whether you work with golfers for a living or are interested in improving your own game, there's plenty to learn from studying an outlier like Christo.

Characteristics, Not Faults In our Level 1 course, we’re intentional about referring to potential mechanical inefficiencies in swings as characteristics, not faults. They are elements which make a swing unique, but not necessarily ineffective. Name any characteristic and we’ll point to a dozen players on various tours who have it. That said, understanding how characteristics may be related to physical limitations and how they can inhibit a golfer’s efficiency can help guide recommendations related to training or technique. Christo has a characteristic we refer to as Late Buckle. Normally, after a player makes contact with the ball and the club releases around their body, there is a corresponding lift or standing tall into the finish position. A Late Buckle is when a player actually dips down and drops after making contact with the ball. In Christo’s case, his late buckle may be a necessary compensation to deliver the club to the ball at his height, especially with more lofted, shorter irons. In transition, Christo squats down several inches, but, unlike most elite ball strikers we evaluate, he doesn’t raise his pelvis vertically during the downswing. It’s likely a primary reason why his vertical force was slightly lower than our PGA TOUR average (190% bodyweight vs 198%), despite his prodigious speed. There was a potential Body-Swing Connection here, as well. We identified a limitation in internal hip mobility on the left side. If internal rotation is limited on the downswing, a golfer may be more likely to slide or buckle, instead of turn. As Dr. Rose says in the video, we want to be careful with unique swings. His kinematic sequence was incredible and he definitely doesn’t need more speed. Our goal was to make him aware of how the characteristic can affect his consistency and highlight how his body could be a contributing factor.

Athlete First

Christo is an impressive athlete, regardless of height. He grew up playing multiple sports such as rugby and soccer, only choosing to specialize in golf as a teenager. This, along with consistent training, has helped develop some of the physical tools which underpin his speed.

Despite weighing (a lean) 240 lbs, Christo’s countermovement jump measured over 4” higher than our PGA TOUR average. His potential to generate force with his lower body is immense. Additionally, he performed extremely well on our movement screen. His range of motion and motor control is terrific in most areas, especially impressive for an athlete of his size.

While it’s entirely possible to play great golf with poor movement capabilities or power potential, it is not an optimal strategy for maximizing performance and durability.

Christo has worked to make his physicality an asset. It needs to be, too. The torque he produced on our force plates was as high as any golfer in our database. Total torque is highly correlated with speed, but it can also be an indication of stress on the body. Developing capacity and maintaining mobility is important for all golfers, but especially for one with such a powerful, unique move.

Ramp Time

Christo is a poster-child for a concept we like to refer to as “ramp time.” As we discuss in our advanced Power courses, to improve speed, golfers can either apply more force to the grip or apply that force for a longer period of time. A longer backswing gives golfers more of a runway to generate speed.

In fact, research from Dr. Sasho Mackenzie suggests that if a golfer were to lengthen their backswing by just 4” they could increase their club head speed by an additional 2.4 mph. While we can’t create taller golfers, it underscores the importance of helping them develop longer backswings by improving mobility in the gym or technique on the lesson tee (such as lifting the lead heel).

It didn't matter if Christo was 4'8"" or 6'8"", our process would remain the same. We want to evaluate what he does, how he does it and explore reasons why he might do it that way. From here we're able to make more qualified recommendations related to his coaching, training or treatment.",[],,www.mytpi.com,"Christo Lamprecht Under The Hood of One of The Fastest Swings in Golf Golfers come in all shapes and sizes, but South Africas rising star, Christo Lamprecht, is a definitely outlier.

Our latest video featuring Joel Dahmen during his visit to TPI ahead of the 2025 season not only will confirm why he's a fan favorite on the PGA TOUR, but should highlight several things every golfer can do to improve their game.

Here are three lessons you or your golfers can learn from our assessment with Joel:

Consistent Pre-Shot Process

At the start of the video, Joel mentioned that he was very consistent with his driver, but struggled with his short-game. Something that stood out about his approach to both was that he had a consistent pre-shot process with his driver, but not with his short-game.

In both practice and play, a consistent process is critical for skill acquisition and performance. As Dr. Rose likes to say:

“Quality practice is not about how many balls you hit, it’s about how many processes you run.”

Practice should make a golfer mentally tired, not just physically tired.

Is Power Limited By the Engine, Equipment or Technique

The primary goal of the power assessment we teach in our advanced Fitness and Power courses is to determine if a golfer’s speed is limited by their technique, their equipment or their physical capacity. If a golfer swinging as fast as their technique and equipment allows, we know we need to improve their ability to express power physically.

Some golfers can improve speed by addressing technique, equipment or intent, but others won’t get faster until they increase the size of their engine.



Here’s Dr. Rose from Power Level 3. pic.twitter.com/dIgkcvpHit — TPI (@MyTPI) July 20, 2022

In the video, Dr. Rose cautions Joel about using overspeed/overload training devices. We’ve been massive proponents of this strategy for the last decade and, while the training devices are incredibly effective, we advise athletes to build a solid foundation of strength and movement quality before rushing to train speed.

Training an athlete for power is like building a skyscraper. To build the tallest skyscraper, we want to establish a solid foundation. Our Level 1 and Power screens help identify if there are any cracks in the foundation.

Down in Chipping

If you’ve been following our feed recently, you might be familiar with this concept. It’s one of the more compelling insights we’ve uncovered from evaluating force plate data from hundreds of professional golfers over the last few years.

When we measured Joel's center of mass while chipping, we noticed it was dropping in the downswing. This is something we often see in golfers who complain of inconsistent contact in their short game.

In chipping, we look at the lower body as the foundation and the hands as the technique. If the foundation is unstable, the technique will suffer.

Down is death in your short game.

In this video’s “PGA TOUR players are not like the rest of us” moment, Joel hit the stick from 20 yards away twice in a row after applying the feel of not going down. Like all TOUR players, he is wildly talented and extremely hard-working. The goal of our assessments is to make sure he's working on the right things.

At just 20 years old, South African Aldrich Potgieter is leading the PGA TOUR in average driving distance. We had the opportunity to evaluate Aldrich in our lab and wanted to highlight some of the key kinetic and kinematic data behind his prodigious speed:

Total Torque: Total torque is one of the kinetic variables most-closely associated with clubhead speed. Essentially, it tells us how well a golfers ""twists"" in the frontal, sagittal and horizontal planes. Unsurprisingly, Aldrich creates as much total torque as any TOUR player we've evaluated.

Timing: If you've followed our content for any period of time, you're probably familiar with this topic. While measuring the magnitude of ground reaction forces is important, how much force a golfer generates almost doesn't matter if the timing is too late. Aldrich's vertical force peaks extremely early in the downswing, giving him more time to transfer that energy to the club. Most higher-handicappers we evaluate generate their force much later than him.

Shoulder Turn: In order to generate more clubhead speed, a golfer can either apply more average force or apply that force for a longer time (a longer hand path). We like to refer to it as ""ramp time."" Aldrich makes a large shoulder turn, which allows him a longer ramp to accelerate the club.

X-Factor: As we outlined in our article about our assessment with Patrick Cantlay, too much x-factor can be a bad thing. However, if a golfer isn't able to create separation between their upper body and lower body, they won't be able to engage their oblique abdominals which are a key contributor to torso rotation velocity. Aldrich creates excellent separation of his upper body and lower body, a hallmark of elite rotational athletes.

Lag: We generally don't coach or cue ""lag."" We see it as a product of quality movement. If we see issues with lag (or casting), we usually look at the lower body first as improving sequence (starting downswing with lower body) is often a long-term solve. Aldrich has a beautiful kinematic sequence and does a terrific job initiating the downswing with the lower body, which helps him set the club.

Aldrich came in a few weeks after carding a 59 at a Korn Ferry Tour event. His game was dialed and the data reflected it. After hours of poking and proding, Dave and Greg had one major takeaway: ""Don't change a thing.""

Had an opportunity to assess Aldrich in our lab last spring, a few weeks after he shot 59 on the @KornFerryTour.

https://www.mytpi.com/articles/swing/tom-hoge-wanted-more-speed-here's-how-we-helped-him-find-it,Tom Hoge Wanted More Speed - Here's How We Helped Him Find It,"Tom Hoge Wanted More Speed - Here's How We Helped Him Find It

Tom Hoge wants 190 mph ball speed. At least, that’s the running joke between him and his coach, Scott Hamilton. Scott, one of the best coaches in the world, would be happy with 175 mph, but Tom is determined to prove that he can touch 190.

While 190 mph is probably not necessary, Tom could benefit from adding a few mph. This year, he ranks 158th in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee, while cruising at 170 mph ball speed (PGA TOUR average is 174 mph). Since ball speed is so closely related to driving performance, we knew we wanted to look for ways we could cheat some more speed out of his swing.

After evaluating his physical capabilities, force and 3D data, we identified three opportunities to improve his scoring potential off the tee.

The Driver is a “Specialty Shot”

We believe there is a misconception that golfers only have one swing. ""Specialty shots"" like a flop shot and chip shot have significantly different mechanics from a stock 7-iron. Similarly, we believe the driver is a specialty shot.

Tom is an ELITE iron player, ranking 18th in SG: Approach in 2025 and 4th in SG: Approach in 2024. However, the mechanics that make him great with an iron don’t necessarily benefit him with a driver.

While an iron is struck with a descending blow (negative attack angle), the best drivers in the world typically have a positive attack angle. Therefore, swinging a driver with “iron mechanics” might not be efficient, especially if hoping to generate significant speed.

One of the most effective and least invasive strategies to encourage a positive angle of attack is to adjust set up. We call it plumb bob. Here's Greg explaining it in our Power Level 3 course:

Many amateur golfers try to tilt their upper body to feel loaded into their trail leg or achieve attack angle, but this tends to move the center of their pelvis in front of the center of their stance at set up. pic.twitter.com/VlBFLu5ffQ — TPI (@MyTPI) March 20, 2023

Load to Explode

“You can’t shut a shut door.”

If you’ve watched our channel this last year, you’ve probably heard that line from Greg. He’s referring to players who stay on their lead leg in the backswing instead of loading into the trail leg. If all of their pressure is towards the target in the backswing, they have no incentive to drive that way in transition.

In evaluating Tom’s force plate data, it was clear that lateral force was low relative to our PGA TOUR average. While vertical force and torque are most closely associated with club head speed, lateral force is critical for adding energy to the system. Consider why a pitcher strides down the mound or why a quarterback steps into a throw.

Greg was encouraging Tom to load more onto his trail side so that he could drive to the lead side.

New Swing, New Driver Specs

It should be a crime for any golfer to play with poorly fit equipment. In terms of improving golf performance, optimizing equipment is the easy button. Gym work is hard. Swing work is hard. Equipment changes are easy.

Tom came in with a driver that was perfectly dialed for his swing, but after Greg’s recommendations changed his attack angle, he needed different settings to optimize launch and spin loft.

This video from our Golf Level 2 online course highlights the importance of spin loft and how we can control it:

Managing Spin Loft can unlock more distance without more speed.



Spin Loft is the difference between Dynamic Loft and Angle of Attack. Increasing the Angle of Attack can reduce Spin Loft which will decrease spin rate and increase distance.

Whenever we evaluate a golfer, we’re always looking at WHAT they are doing, HOW they are doing it, and WHY they might do it that way. To see what they are doing, we use video and 3D motion capture. To understand how they are doing it, we look at force plate data. And to connect the why, we take them through our physical screen.

Our recent evaluation of 2023 European Amatuer champion and Arizona State standout, Jose Ballester, was a fascinating case study in how this data can reveal unique strategies among the most effective swings in the world.

Jose is a tremendous ball-striker with elite speed, but he does it differently than most of the players we see.

When we dug into Jose’s 3D, force and physical data, it revealed his “superpowers,” specifically his ability to lag the club on the downswing and create something called moment arm by how he pushes against the ground.

Dr. Rose explains in the latest case study from our lab:

When we evaluate ground reaction forces in a golf swing, HOW and WHEN an athlete pushes against the ground can be just as important as HOW HARD.

The most powerful golfers in the world not only create a lot of force, they do it earlier in the downswing than slower players. Most of the research suggests that we want to maximize vertical force at shaft vertical downswing (or lead arm parallel). Jose, like most high-clubhead speed players, does this well.

What’s particularly unique about Jose’s kinetic data is that he “only” generates around 150% of his total bodyweight in vertical force on the downswing. The PGA TOUR average in our database is almost 200%. Being one of the faster players in golf, we would’ve expected him to be higher.

So how does he create so much torque while applying less force than his peers? He has a longer moment arm.

This is a concept we discuss in-depth in our Power and Golf Level 3 seminars. While it should probably never be a player's swing thought, moment arm is an important variable to understand.

Probably the easiest way to think about moment arm is to imagine loosening a nut with a wrench. If you were given an option to rotate a nut with a wrench that had a 1” long handle or one with a 12” long handle, which would you choose? The 12” handle, right? This is because the longer handle allows us to apply force further from the center of rotation (the nut). The longer wrench creates the potential for a longer moment arm.

Similarly, by positioning his body to push against the ground further from his center of rotation, Jose “creates a long wrench.” His moment arm was 13"" whereas our PGA TOUR average is about 6"".

Again, optimizing ground reaction forces in golfers is about how they push, not just how hard.

This is another example of how we try to understand how a golfer’s physical capabilities match what they’re doing in their swing.

It’s the goal of our Level 1 and advanced course curriculum and what you can expect in an evaluation with a TPI Certified expert near you.

Before making recommendations related to a golfer’s technique, training or treatment, we want to consider their WHAT, HOW and WHY.

When studying the kinetics of the most powerful and effective ball-strikers on the planet, one of the characteristics that separates elite players from high-handicappers isn't just how much force the generate, but how soon they do it in the downswing.

This is one of the key concepts that we discuss in our Power Level 2 course and our Power Level 3 seminar (above). Whether creating a feel in the gym or analyzing ground reaction force data, we want to help golfers learn to push against the ground (especially with their lead foot) earlier in the downswing.

After all, it doesn’t really matter what kind of power a golfer can generate if they don’t apply force early enough to contribute to the angular velocity of the club.

Below are examples of how PGA National Teacher of the Year Mark Blackburn and five-time World Long Drive Champion Jason Zuback help golfers improve power potential by optimizing ground reaction force in the gym and on the range.

https://golftipsmag.com/instruction/full-swing/,Full Swing -,"We have all heard it. When getting information about aim and alignment, we often hear to “finish your swing facing your target.” Don’t do it — you will likely hit a shot that will not end up on line. You need to finish your swing facing LEFT of the target.

Look at all the Tour pros out there, including Jessica Korda (above): They are clearly facing well left of their target at the finish, and that goes all the way back to proper set-up and address. Here’s how to put it all together:

AIM AND ALIGNMENT

First, place your hands on the grip, keeping the clubface square.

Then, aim the square clubface to the target on the line you established from behind the ball. The leading edge of your golf club will be at a right angle to the target line.

Next, align your body (checking feet, thighs, hips, and shoulders) parallel and left of the target line, addressing the golf ball.

If you feel as if you are really left of your target, you will be aligned correctly. Do not align your body to the target…aim your club at the target and align your body left of the target! (For left-handers — right of the target)

Last, with confidence, trust your aim and alignment and make your best effort to create the shot. Even if you do not hit it perfectly, it will likely be on line, heading towards the intended target—a great miss!

COMPLETE YOUR SWING

This is accurate information: Left is “Right” (correct) at address. However, finishing with your belt buckle facing the target line is stopping short of the full completion of the swing circle.

When you finish a good golf swing, your belt buckle will actually be facing LEFT of your target if you have completed the swing circle. The ball will track towards the target on the line you established in your pre-shot routine, but your body will not finish facing the target. If it does, it could result in a shot that leaks to the right of the intended target.

Think in terms of the two lines at address that might help you understand this critical piece of information relating to the completion of your golf swing motion.

Imagine that the target line is the “ball target” and the parallel line you have lined up your body on is the “body target.” The two lines are parallel at address and remain so during the swing motion, but it is just the golf ball that (hopefully) ends up on the “ball target” line you established.

Ideally, you will end up in a balanced finish position, facing the “body target” line you set at address, clearly left of the ball target line. The swing circle motion has been completed, allowing both the operator and the equipment to hit a shot “on line” to the target!

Understanding this very thing has been instrumental for improved aim, alignment, and result with my students. See if this perception change alters the directional reality of your golf shots.

As my students and I often say about these actions that improve your motion and game, “If you can, you MUST!”

– Perfect Golf Swing –

This section was designed to give golfers illustrated swing tips on how to swing a golf club, to present the textbook version of “the perfect golf swing”, essentially.

It also provides information on how golfers can deviate from that perfect golf swing and instead veer towards golf swing errors. The information is broken down into the components that make up a golf swing and comparative illustrations are used in order to quickly highlight key differences.

Use these illustrated guides for quick but detailed help on how to improve your golf swing and its many components.

The address and setup stage of the golf swing involves assuming the correct position before the swing actually starts. There are many elements to consider and overlooking key areas at the start will snowball into issues down the line.

Among other things, the club should rest flat behind the ball. It should be held by the golfer with hands flowing straight down from the shoulders. The knees should be comfortably bent and the upper body tilted forward and straight. The right hand being lower than the left will put the shoulders on an upward slope. The weight is evenly divided between the two feet and rests mostly on the ball of the feet.

Finally, the shaft of the club is angled forward slightly, the clubface is perpendicular to the target and the feet are parallel to the target line.

The takeaway portion of the golf swing begins as soon as the club starts moving back and ends when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground. During that short period of time, several critical moves must happen in order to put the swing on a good track.

Indeed, the club should be taken back square so that the shaft points at the target when it is parallel to the ground. At the same time, the clubface should point down slightly and wrists shouldn’t be allowed to hinge this early in the swing.

Go to:

Takeaway Swing Tips

The backswing portion of the golf swing begins just as the takeaway ends. It will end itself when the top of the swing is reached. While getting there, several aspects need careful attention.

The left arm should remain straight and the left heel should remain on the ground unless flexibility issues demand otherwise. The right knee should retain its flex and the left knee should point towards the ball. Hips rotate but they do so without sliding back. While the head stays in the box, the weight still flows towards the right foot. This whole process should proceed at a pace that is slower than that of the downswing in order to produce a solid strike at the ball.

Go to:

Backswing Tips

The top of the golf swing corresponds to the halfway point between the address position and the moment of impact. It represents the position when your hands are highest and the transition point between the backswing and the downswing.

The left wrist should be flat at the top and your spine angle should still resemble the one set at address. The shaft of the club should point towards the target and it should be just shy of parallel to the ground. Your back should face the target and your wrists should be fully hinged.

Go to:

Top of the Swing Tips

The downswing portion of the golf swing corresponds to the stage immediately following the top of the swing, as the hands and club are brought down towards the impact with the ball.

Your hips should move first by starting to uncoil but they should do so without sliding forward much. They should allow for the smooth weight transition towards the front left foot as your shoulders uncoil in tandem. The hinge in your wrists are kept for as long as possible and your clubhead should follow a path that allows it to be square with the target at impact, the next stage. This whole process should be executed at a noticeably faster pace than the one used to bring the club up.

Go to:

Downswing Tips

The moment of impact is the only point in time when your body – through the golf club – will actually come in contact with the ball or exert any influence on it. Despite the long journey that precedes it, there are still key elements to focus on in order to promote a pure strike at the ball in what should be a straight shot.

Hands should be ahead of the ball at impact. Your spine forward bend should closely match the one set at address still. Your eyes should be trained on the ball and your hips and hands should be facing the target, or well on their way. An impact made with an iron should be made on a downward motion while one made with a wood should be made after the club has reached the lowest point of the swing arc, as the clubhead is rising.

Go to:

Impact Swing Tips

The release and extension sequence of the golf swing occurs after impact with the ball. It corresponds to the phase that precedes the final golf position, i.e., the follow through.

The term extension comes from the fact that both of your arms should be fully extended during the release. Furthermore, your spine angle should be identical to that of the impact position, implying that you should resist the urge to straighten your body. Your forearms and hands, which started to ‘roll’ during the downswing will complete their rotation, with the bottom hand on the club now leading your top hand towards the target.

Go to:

Release Swing Tips

Despite taking place after contact with the ball has already been made the way your body is positioned during the follow through will be indicative of the motions that preceded it. And focusing on reaching a desirable follow through position will help you perform the previous golf swing stages correctly.

Among other things, your hands should release naturally after the wrists are allowed to unhinge. Your hands and clubhead should circle back around your body as your body weight is moved towards the left foot. Finally, your hips should be facing the target and you should resist the urge to quit swinging after the club has hit the ball. Instead a full follow through, proud and high is sought.

Go to:

Follow Through Swing Tips

Your driver is built differently than your other golf clubs. Also, it makes contact with the ball while the ball is held up from the ground on a tee. As such, there are key differences between how you hit golf shots using your irons and wedges vs how you hit a drive using your driver.

As far as the address position is concerned, the ball will be located further forward in your stance, in line with the instep of your front foot. This position will allow the driver to ‘hit up on the ball’, as the club is rising from its lowest point of the swing arc.

Since your driver likely features a longer shaft than your other golf clubs, the ball will be located further away from your feet. With your hands addressing the ball forward, your spine angle will be tilted back slightly, with a little more than half of your weight located atop your back foot.

In order to hit the ball far down the fairway, your driver swing will likely be as long as your physical abilities allow. This is in contrast to a wedge shot where precision is preferred over distance. You should also allow your swing plane to be flatter, again in contrast to your wedges and because of the longer club shaft.

Your forearms and hands, which started to roll during the downswing will complete their rotation, with the bottom hand on the club now leading your top hand towards the target. Go to Release Swing Tips Despite taking place after contact with the ball has already been made the way your body is positioned during the follow through will be indicative of the motions that preceded it. And focusing on reaching a desirable follow through position will help you perform the previous golf swing stages correctly. Among other things, your hands should release naturally after the wrists are allowed to unhinge. Your hands and clubhead should circle back around your body as your body weight is moved towards the left foot. Finally, your hips should be facing the target and you should resist the urge to quit swinging after the club has hit the ball. Instead a full follow through, proud and high is sought. Go to Follow Through Swing Tips Your driver is built differently than your other golf clubs. Also, it makes contact with the ball while the ball is held up from the ground on a tee. As such, there are key differences between how you hit golf shots using your irons and wedges vs how you hit a drive using your driver. As far as the address position is concerned, the ball will be located further forward in your stance, in line with the instep of your front foot. This position will allow the driver to hit up on the ball, as the club is rising from its lowest point of the swing arc. Since your driver likely features a longer shaft than your other golf clubs, the ball will be located further away from your feet. With your hands addressing the ball forward, your spine angle will be tilted back slightly, with a little more than half of your weight located atop your back foot. In order to hit the ball far down the fairway, your driver swing will likely be as long as your physical abilities allow. This is in contrast to a wedge shot where precision is preferred over distance. You should also allow your swing plane to be flatter, again in contrast to your wedges and because of the longer club shaft.

The information is broken down into the components that make up a golf swing and comparative illustrations are used in order to quickly highlight key differences. Use these illustrated guides for quick but detailed help on how to improve your golf swing and its many components. The address and setup stage of the golf swing involves assuming the correct position before the swing actually starts. There are many elements to consider and overlooking key areas at the start will snowball into issues down the line. Among other things, the club should rest flat behind the ball. It should be held by the golfer with hands flowing straight down from the shoulders. The knees should be comfortably bent and the upper body tilted forward and straight. The right hand being lower than the left will put the shoulders on an upward slope. The weight is evenly divided between the two feet and rests mostly on the ball of the feet. Finally, the shaft of the club is angled forward slightly, the clubface is perpendicular to the target and the feet are parallel to the target line. The takeaway portion of the golf swing begins as soon as the club starts moving back and ends when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground. During that short period of time, several critical moves must happen in order to put the swing on a good track. Indeed, the club should be taken back square so that the shaft points at the target when it is parallel to the ground. At the same time, the clubface should point down slightly and wrists shouldnt be allowed to hinge this early in the swing. Go to Takeaway Swing Tips The backswing portion of the golf swing begins just as the takeaway ends. It will end itself when the top of the swing is reached. While getting there, several aspects need careful attention. The left arm should remain straight and the left heel should remain on the ground unless flexibility issues demand otherwise. The right knee should retain its flex and the left knee should point towards the ball. Hips rotate but they do so without sliding back. While the head stays in the box, the weight still flows towards the right foot. This whole process should proceed at a pace that is slower than that of the downswing in order to produce a solid strike at the ball. Go to Backswing Tips The top of the golf swing corresponds to the halfway point between the address position and the moment of impact. It represents the position when your hands are highest and the transition point between the backswing and the downswing. The left wrist should be flat at the top and your spine angle should still resemble the one set at address. The shaft of the club should point towards the target and it should be just shy of parallel to the ground. Your back should face the target and your wrists should be fully hinged. Go to Top of the Swing Tips The downswing portion of the golf swing corresponds to the stage immediately following the top of the swing, as the hands and club are brought down towards the impact with the ball. Your hips should move first by starting to uncoil but they should do so without sliding forward much. They should allow for the smooth weight transition towards the front left foot as your shoulders uncoil in tandem. The hinge in your wrists are kept for as long as possible and your clubhead should follow a path that allows it to be square with the target at impact, the next stage. This whole process should be executed at a noticeably faster pace than the one used to bring the club up. Go to Downswing Tips The moment of impact is the only point in time when your body through the golf club will actually come in contact with the ball or exert any influence on it. Despite the long journey that precedes it, there are still key elements to focus on in order to promote a pure strike at the ball in what should be a straight shot. Hands should be ahead of the ball at impact. Your spine forward bend should closely match the one set at address still. Your eyes should be trained on the ball and your hips and hands should be facing the target, or well on their way. An impact made with an iron should be made on a downward motion while one made with a wood should be made after the club has reached the lowest point of the swing arc, as the clubhead is rising. Go to Impact Swing Tips The release and extension sequence of the golf swing occurs after impact with the ball. It corresponds to the phase that precedes the final golf position, i.e., the follow through. The term extension comes from the fact that both of your arms should be fully extended during the release.

From reading this article, you will hopefully get a good understanding of how a golf club can be swung in a repeatable and powerful motion.

However, this article is for informational purposes, and we highly recommend lessons with a PGA teaching professional, they are very beneficial to learning the game of golf. If you start with good fundamentals and principles, this will help set you in the longer term to become a better golf player.

Grip the club creating connection!

It is essential you grip your golf club properly, as this will affect the impact on the golf ball’s trajectory and flight. When it comes to golf swing basics, the correct grip is extremely important to help you square the club head to the golf ball. Choosing the right grip can stop elbow pain developing.

Grip size

Generally golf clubs are fitted with a standard size grip. Getting fitted for your clubs really helps, as there are many sizes and thicknesses of grip available to make it more comfortable. In most cases the standard grips are suitable for golfers with smaller hands. Golfers who have larger hands often require midsize grips or more layers of tape under the grip.

The golf grip involves two parts.

The upper hand, or lead hand, is placed higher at the end of the grip handle, then your lower hand or trailing hand is placed under to add to the grip.

Many golfers have an overlapping grip either using an interlock or Vardon grip. This will help the hands work together in the swing.

There are three different strengths of golf grip

1) The neutral grip

To set up a neutral grip start by positioning your club face square to the ball at address aiming at your target.

Position your lead hand on the grip and ensure that only two knuckles of the lead hand are visible, being the index finger and middle finger. Then position your trail hand below your lead hand and ensure that only the knuckles of the index finger and the middle finger of the trail hand are visible.

2) The strong grip

Setting up with a stronger grip promotes a closed club face through impact, this will result in a draw or hook of your golf ball, due to your hands turning over more through impact.

By placing your leading hand on the grip, allowing the ring finger to become visible together with the two knuckles of the trail hand. This will give you a stronger grip at address.

3) The weak grip

Setting up for a weak grip is the opposite of a strong grip, where the lead hand leans more toward the non-dominant side. This results in only the index knuckle being visible at address, promoting an open club face at impact producing a fade or slice ball trajectory.

Golf Swing Planes

What is golf swing plane?

The golf swing plane is the angle and path created by your club as it travels in to your back swing from the address position, reaching the top of your backswing and then back through the ball to your follow through position.

There are two types of swing, the One-Plane and Two-Plane swing:

One-plane

The one plane golf swing can be a preferred choice, as this technique is simple and requires less timing to be accurate. It allows for a more shallow swing plane around the body, this enables better players who are looking to draw the ball more in their swing. The plane at the address remains the same throughout the entire swing, making the swing easier to repeat.

The one plane swing is good for players that have good upper body flexibility and strong recoil. Many top modern golf professionals have changed towards one plane swings, as they have specific golf strength and flexibility, allowing this type of motion.

Two-plane

The two-plane swing is more complicated and steeper than the one-plane swing. The backswing is much more upright, and then by dropping your hands during the transition phase, the downswing becomes a much flatter plane. This type of swing is also characterised by the lead arm swinging upwards to be in a more upright position, than the shoulders at the top of the swing.

The two-plane swing helps promote an increase in swing speed and distance. To swing a golf club like this is more suited to players that may not be as flexible, but they have excellent timing and rhythm in their golf swing.

Refine the best golf posture

Posture is a key fundamental and one of the golf swing basics of creating a solid golf swing. Getting yourself into optimal golf posture is crucial in your setup, when you are addressing the golf ball. Your swing relies on a consistent and solid foundation being retained; this helps you deliver a solid strike of the golf ball.

It is really important to develop your golf posture by adopting an athletic position and aligning your body parallel to the target line for straighter and more accurate golf shots. Let your body hinge forward at your hips and keep knees slightly bent, arms naturally fall down to your sides, before bringing in to grip your club in a relaxed manner and position. Your final golf posture should feel comfortable, relaxed and prepared for movement to swing a golf club.

Good body alignment

In golf, you need to be precise where you are aiming and to be accurate. It is really important to set yourself, so you know where you want the ball to start before you can hit many good golf shots.

When addressing the ball, it is really important to establish your target line, making sure your left foot and right foot are aligned towards your target. As your upper body tilts forward, it is important to keep your knees bent, let your shoulders match your foot line aiming at the target line.

Always check your alignment as you set up. Try to think of an imaginary line passing from your back shoulder to front shoulder, and another line from left foot to right foot, pointing directly at your target. This is referred to as keeping your alignment “square to target”.

An easy way to check your alignment at the golf course, get into your golf stance and place a golf club on the practice ground teeing area, ensuring it runs along the tips of your toes. Then take a step back from the golf club and look at the direction the club shaft is pointing. Ideally it should be pointed either directly at your target or slightly left.

Ball position

The position of your golf ball actually changes depending on which club you are using. The reason we move this position to swing a golf club is that we want to achieve optimal impact position and launch conditions. Ball position is changed to swing a golf club to achieve the best ball flight for the club in hand.

The longer the club, the further forward the ball position. For example, when using your driver the ball should be farthest forward, just inside your left heel. As you come down the clubs, moving progressively the ball farther back until you get to your wedges, here the ball should sit squarely in the middle of your stance.

What does your golf swing involve?

Backswing

The golf backswing is a really important part of the swing, how you raise the golf club away from the target towards your back from address position really dictates what happens to the rest of your swing. A poor backswing and takeaway can and will often result in a poorly executed full swing.

Try to start your swing by taking the hands in a straight line back, while holding them near to your back leg and keeping your left arm in a straight line while you do this. Simultaneously let your whole body rotate as you take the club away. As the club face pivots away towards the back swing try to keep width in your arms.

During the backswing, your trunk will rotate more than your pelvis rotation, this helps transfer the weight from your front foot to your back foot. It is really important to maintain good balance as you rotate onto your trail side. If you can develop good shoulder turn this will really help you get into the correct sequencing developing a strong swing.

When moving your arms move towards the top of your swing, your wrist will start to cock and the club should virtually be at right angles to your front arm, while the butt of the club is aiming marginally outside the golf ball. Continue turning, whilst pushing your hands and arms back until the club faces down the target line behind your head.

Your lead shoulder should turn under your chin and behind the ball to reach the top of the backswing. Keep your torso bent as you turn, maintaining posture and balance whilst keeping your back leg bent. When reaching the top of your backswing, your body should be completely coiled and geared up for the downswing.

Transition of the swing

Once you have completed your backswing, there is often a slight delay before commencing the downswing. Rushing your downswing is almost certain to prevent good contact and sequencing in your swing. Take your time at the top of your backswing, allows you to harmonise all the moving parts in your swing, creating an effortless rhythm for solid ball contact. Try to learn good timing by transitioning with rhythm at the top position of your swing, before you start your downswing.

Downswing and impact position

Following a smooth take away into your backswing and a well timed transition at the top, the downswing should likewise be smooth in rhythm to maintain control of all the parts engaged in the swing and to help sequencing in the downswing. The downswing should start slowly and build speed progressively as the club approaches the impact position, until you reach maximum club head speed at impact.

Initiate your downswing by loading into your leg leg and sense that your right shoulder and right hip drive in sequence towards the ball direction and that your arms are falling downwards as your hips clear to your left side for peak speed at impact.

The synchronised movement of the hip and shoulders, involves the hips firing faster and staying ahead of the shoulders, allowing the lower body to lead the swing. By starting the swing this way and using your hips will help generate power through your hip drive first and foremost. Ensure you turn in to your left side instead of sliding ahead too much, this helps avoid reverse pivoting and gets you moving towards the target, promoting the creation of maximum speed and power in your swing.

If you start the downswing by sliding your hips forward too soon, this encourages your body to lean backwards, creating a reverse pivot that slows your swing down and prevents you from covering the golf properly achieving the highest swing speed you can.

Finish and follow through

Following through and finishing balanced towards your target is a key golf swing fundamental. Many golfers believe that once they create contact with the ball and the club face, their swing is complete. Although good contact is important, stopping your swing at that point will result in the deceleration of the head at the exact moment, when in fact acceleration should be at its highest. This continues right through to a balanced finish extending to the target. If you do not complete the follow through this severely affects your ball trajectory and your balance. In the finish position, your body should have rotated right through to have your belt buckle pointing towards the target, your weight balanced on your lead foot with the trailing foot balanced on it’s big toe, the club should be positioned high behind your head and body stable.

You should be able to maintain your finish position, as if you are posing for photos as you watch the ball flying towards your target. That is the correct way to swing a golf club, watching many amateur players they struggle to extend through and balance in their finish position.

How to swing a golf club – the magical tip!

Every golfer has their own unique swing, and you should not focus too much on what your swing looks like, but more on feel and performance. Golfers tend to offer golf tips to each other, but each of us has different physiology and skill sets, thus what works for you may not work for someone else. Your swing may not be textbook, but you must learn what works best for you and your body. Taking lessons with a PGA professional is very helpful, as they will understand cues and drills to get the best out of your individual golf swings.

Keep your head down

A simple swing thought is to keep looking down at the back of the ball, even after making contact stay down for a short period. Let your head come up naturally at the moment you can no longer stay down during the follow through. In contrast, lifting your head too early just before impact and taking your eye off the ball, can result in poor contact with ball. This is often one of the first swing instructions given to many beginner golfers. Often beginners are very anxious to see where the ball will go after they hit it, which often leads to them lifting their heads and taking their eyes off the ball at impact.

It is a natural predisposition of many golfers to look at where their ball is going instead of pausing to see contact made between the club face and the golf ball.

When you swing hard, fast and powerfully, this will tend to force your head up due to the impetus generated. When this happens this can cause for you to lift your club head. This movement alters your swing path and frequently leads to you topping or mishitting the ball.

Weight transfer

In your swing, as you turn backwards you naturally transfer your body weight from the centre to your back foot loading into your leg with a soft right knee. As you initiate your downswing, your weight is driven back across to your left side towards the intended target. Maintain the flex in your knees as you downswing to aid the weight transfer to the front foot. Then drive the hips up and around, as left knee straightens, allowing you to stack onto the left leg shifting forward in the direction of the target.

To help get correct weight transfer in your swing, avoid driving your weight too early or beginning the down swing movement leading with your hands too quickly. By doing this, can result in altered path and angle of the club head, which can influence the speed and direction of the golf shot.

Some tips to build a great golf swing

Let us look at some simple tips that you can use to build a better golf swing and allow you to become more competitive. Each of these golf swing tips are aimed to help raise your game. It is recommended that you practice each of the golf tips individually, stick with one change until it feels natural, and you master it.

Tip #1: Control direction with your lead hand

With time you can learn to control the club face and direction with the back of your lead hand. For example, in your golf swing, if you point the back of your lead hand to the left of your target. By doing this closes the club face at impact and promotes a draw ball flight. To fade the ball, hit your shots where you point the back of your lead hand to the right of the target, opening the face at impact. Many professional golfers develop this skill and can point the back of their lead hand for as long as possible after impact to direct the ball to its target and improving their accuracy.

Tip #2: Improve golf grip for straighter shots

How you take grip of the golf club will affect how you swing the club, and you can really neutral pattern your swing with an improved grip. Having a good neutral grip on the club, will make your shots fly straighter at your target. It is important to grip the club softly, but firmly. It helps at set up to wiggle the club a bit to release the tension in your forearm and wrists. It is a good idea to practice the grip to discover what gives you the best feel to hit solid golf shots.

Tip #3: Swing smoothly for better tempo

Most beginner golfers swing too hard and quickly, and this quick swing can throw you off balance and affect your accuracy. To help slow a fast swing, you can count throughout the swing process slowing your swing. May be count one when you start the swing, two when you reach the top of your backswing, then three at the point of impact, and four once you conclude with a balanced finish.

Tip #4: Know your target

Many golfers think too much about the golf swing, they neglect to set up properly aiming correctly at the target. The really important part of the golf swing is when you hit the ball and as the club releases to where you want the ball to go. Pick a spot a couple of steps in front of you to align yourself to the target. It helps to be focused on a small target before taking your swing, as this improves your dispersion. It is important not to get too caught up in your swing and focus on your target instead and the type of shot you want to hit.

Obviously, your golf swing does matter, but do not analyse this on the golf course, as it will get you nowhere if you do not focus on your aim.

Tip #5: Adjust your stance for a better strike

Just by setting up properly helps many golfers hit the ball with the middle of the golf club head. Poor execution often arises because of a poor setup, standing in the correct position with the ball in the correct position really helps for an efficient golf swing. Ensure you aim for a golf posture that puts your body in a balanced and athletic position. Your body then can rotate freely around your centre of axis, and you can maintain this throughout the swing.

What else can you do to improve your golf swing?

There are many physical and technical aspects to swinging a golf club, and your mind plays an equally significant role. It is important to keep a clear and strong mindset during your swing sequence, really learn to develop a clear picture of the shot you need to hit. Creating consistency in your swing involves good preparation and commitment. It is vital to build a good routine to help build a fluid swing maintaining the same tempo and balance from the takeaway to the finish. There is a time to swing hard and fast but try to stay away from using aggressive force to generate speed. Try to start with an effortless swing and speed it up as you learn good patterns and timing. It is important not to tense up when swinging your golf club.

Golf is an atypical sport, where hand-eye coordination plays a huge role over athletic prowess. The golf ball is static when you strike it and that point makes performing the golf club swing with control more important than swinging with speed like in baseball. Timing and good sequencing can create enough power in golf. Get your body golf fit, most amateurs are not supple enough to get into the correct positions for the golf swing. Most of us stay stuck in flexion for the most part at work or commuting. Opening your hips and chest will really help you to extend through the ball and improve your golf swing.

In summary

The golf swing is a very complex process involving many moving parts, which combine to connect the club head and golf ball with perfect timing. Unless you understand the correct sequencing, many will struggle to execute this extraordinarily complex process without knowing the complete process of an effective golf swing. Get some coaching or watch some instructional videos to help you know and understand the golf swing mechanics, this will enable you to help unlearn any golf swing errors and improve your golf game, so that you know how to swing a golf club properly.

It does seem like a lot to think about and learn when it comes to golf, but take it one step at a time and read through this article again from time to time to see where you may be able to improve.

As you come down the clubs, moving progressively the ball farther back until you get to your wedges, here the ball should sit squarely in the middle of your stance. What does your golf swing involve? Backswing The golf backswing is a really important part of the swing, how you raise the golf club away from the target towards your back from address position really dictates what happens to the rest of your swing. A poor backswing and takeaway can and will often result in a poorly executed full swing. Try to start your swing by taking the hands in a straight line back, while holding them near to your back leg and keeping your left arm in a straight line while you do this. Simultaneously let your whole body rotate as you take the club away. As the club face pivots away towards the back swing try to keep width in your arms. During the backswing, your trunk will rotate more than your pelvis rotation, this helps transfer the weight from your front foot to your back foot. It is really important to maintain good balance as you rotate onto your trail side. If you can develop good shoulder turn this will really help you get into the correct sequencing developing a strong swing. When moving your arms move towards the top of your swing, your wrist will start to cock and the club should virtually be at right angles to your front arm, while the butt of the club is aiming marginally outside the golf ball. Continue turning, whilst pushing your hands and arms back until the club faces down the target line behind your head. Your lead shoulder should turn under your chin and behind the ball to reach the top of the backswing. Keep your torso bent as you turn, maintaining posture and balance whilst keeping your back leg bent. When reaching the top of your backswing, your body should be completely coiled and geared up for the downswing. Transition of the swing Once you have completed your backswing, there is often a slight delay before commencing the downswing. Rushing your downswing is almost certain to prevent good contact and sequencing in your swing. Take your time at the top of your backswing, allows you to harmonise all the moving parts in your swing, creating an effortless rhythm for solid ball contact. Try to learn good timing by transitioning with rhythm at the top position of your swing, before you start your downswing. Downswing and impact position Following a smooth take away into your backswing and a well timed transition at the top, the downswing should likewise be smooth in rhythm to maintain control of all the parts engaged in the swing and to help sequencing in the downswing. The downswing should start slowly and build speed progressively as the club approaches the impact position, until you reach maximum club head speed at impact. Initiate your downswing by loading into your leg leg and sense that your right shoulder and right hip drive in sequence towards the ball direction and that your arms are falling downwards as your hips clear to your left side for peak speed at impact. The synchronised movement of the hip and shoulders, involves the hips firing faster and staying ahead of the shoulders, allowing the lower body to lead the swing. By starting the swing this way and using your hips will help generate power through your hip drive first and foremost. Ensure you turn in to your left side instead of sliding ahead too much, this helps avoid reverse pivoting and gets you moving towards the target, promoting the creation of maximum speed and power in your swing. If you start the downswing by sliding your hips forward too soon, this encourages your body to lean backwards, creating a reverse pivot that slows your swing down and prevents you from covering the golf properly achieving the highest swing speed you can. Finish and follow through Following through and finishing balanced towards your target is a key golf swing fundamental. Many golfers believe that once they create contact with the ball and the club face, their swing is complete. Although good contact is important, stopping your swing at that point will result in the deceleration of the head at the exact moment, when in fact acceleration should be at its highest. This continues right through to a balanced finish extending to the target. If you do not complete the follow through this severely affects your ball trajectory and your balance. In the finish position, your body should have rotated right through to have your belt buckle pointing towards the target, your weight balanced on your lead foot with the trailing foot balanced on its big toe, the club should be positioned high behind your head and body stable. You should be able to maintain your finish position, as if you are posing for photos as you watch the ball flying towards your target. That is the correct way to swing a golf club, watching many amateur players they struggle to extend through and balance in their finish position. How to swing a golf club  the magical tip! Every golfer has their own unique swing, and you should not focus too much on what your swing looks like, but more on feel and performance. Golfers tend to offer golf tips to each other, but each of us has different physiology and skill sets, thus what works for you may not work for someone else. Your swing may not be textbook, but you must learn what works best for you and your body. Taking lessons with a PGA professional is very helpful, as they will understand cues and drills to get the best out of your individual golf swings. Keep your head down A simple swing thought is to keep looking down at the back of the ball, even after making contact stay down for a short period. Let your head come up naturally at the moment you can no longer stay down during the follow through. In contrast, lifting your head too early just before impact and taking your eye off the ball, can result in poor contact with ball. This is often one of the first swing instructions given to many beginner golfers. Often beginners are very anxious to see where the ball will go after they hit it, which often leads to them lifting their heads and taking their eyes off the ball at impact. It is a natural predisposition of many golfers to look at where their ball is going instead of pausing to see contact made between the club face and the golf ball. When you swing hard, fast and powerfully, this will tend to force your head up due to the impetus generated. When this happens this can cause for you to lift your club head. This movement alters your swing path and frequently leads to you topping or mishitting the ball. Weight transfer In your swing, as you turn backwards you naturally transfer your body weight from the centre to your back foot loading into your leg with a soft right knee. As you initiate your downswing, your weight is driven back across to your left side towards the intended target. Maintain the flex in your knees as you downswing to aid the weight transfer to the front foot. Then drive the hips up and around, as left knee straightens, allowing you to stack onto the left leg shifting forward in the direction of the target. To help get correct weight transfer in your swing, avoid driving your weight too early or beginning the down swing movement leading with your hands too quickly. By doing this, can result in altered path and angle of the club head, which can influence the speed and direction of the golf shot. Some tips to build a great golf swing Let us look at some simple tips that you can use to build a better golf swing and allow you to become more competitive. Each of these golf swing tips are aimed to help raise your game. It is recommended that you practice each of the golf tips individually, stick with one change until it feels natural, and you master it. Tip 1 Control direction with your lead hand With time you can learn to control the club face and direction with the back of your lead hand. For example, in your golf swing, if you point the back of your lead hand to the left of your target. By doing this closes the club face at impact and promotes a draw ball flight. To fade the ball, hit your shots where you point the back of your lead hand to the right of the target, opening the face at impact. Many professional golfers develop this skill and can point the back of their lead hand for as long as possible after impact to direct the ball to its target and improving their accuracy. Tip 2 Improve golf grip for straighter shots How you take grip of the golf club will affect how you swing the club, and you can really neutral pattern your swing with an improved grip. Having a good neutral grip on the club, will make your shots fly straighter at your target. It is important to grip the club softly, but firmly. It helps at set up to wiggle the club a bit to release the tension in your forearm and wrists. It is a good idea to practice the grip to discover what gives you the best feel to hit solid golf shots. Tip 3 Swing smoothly for better tempo Most beginner golfers swing too hard and quickly, and this quick swing can throw you off balance and affect your accuracy. To help slow a fast swing, you can count throughout the swing process slowing your swing. May be count one when you start the swing, two when you reach the top of your backswing, then three at the point of impact, and four once you conclude with a balanced finish. Tip 4 Know your target Many golfers think too much about the golf swing, they neglect to set up properly aiming correctly at the target. The really important part of the golf swing is when you hit the ball and as the club releases to where you want the ball to go. Pick a spot a couple of steps in front of you to align yourself to the target. It helps to be focused on a small target before taking your swing, as this improves your dispersion. It is important not to get too caught up in your swing and focus on your target instead and the type of shot you want to hit. Obviously, your golf swing does matter, but do not analyse this on the golf course, as it will get you nowhere if you do not focus on your aim. Tip 5 Adjust your stance for a better strike Just by setting up properly helps many golfers hit the ball with the middle of the golf club head. Poor execution often arises because of a poor setup, standing in the correct position with the ball in the correct position really helps for an efficient golf swing. Ensure you aim for a golf posture that puts your body in a balanced and athletic position. Your body then can rotate freely around your centre of axis, and you can maintain this throughout the swing. What else can you do to improve your golf swing? There are many physical and technical aspects to swinging a golf club, and your mind plays an equally significant role. It is important to keep a clear and strong mindset during your swing sequence, really learn to develop a clear picture of the shot you need to hit. Creating consistency in your swing involves good preparation and commitment. It is vital to build a good routine to help build a fluid swing maintaining the same tempo and balance from the takeaway to the finish. There is a time to swing hard and fast but try to stay away from using aggressive force to generate speed. Try to start with an effortless swing and speed it up as you learn good patterns and timing. It is important not to tense up when swinging your golf club. Golf is an atypical sport, where hand-eye coordination plays a huge role over athletic prowess. The golf ball is static when you strike it and that point makes performing the golf club swing with control more important than swinging with speed like in baseball. Timing and good sequencing can create enough power in golf. Get your body golf fit, most amateurs are not supple enough to get into the correct positions for the golf swing. Most of us stay stuck in flexion for the most part at work or commuting. Opening your hips and chest will really help you to extend through the ball and improve your golf swing. In summary The golf swing is a very complex process involving many moving parts, which combine to connect the club head and golf ball with perfect timing. Unless you understand the correct sequencing, many will struggle to execute this extraordinarily complex process without knowing the complete process of an effective golf swing. Get some coaching or watch some instructional videos to help you know and understand the golf swing mechanics, this will enable you to help unlearn any golf swing errors and improve your golf game, so that you know how to swing a golf club properly.

From reading this article, you will hopefully get a good understanding of how a golf club can be swung in a repeatable and powerful motion. However, this article is for informational purposes, and we highly recommend lessons with a PGA teaching professional, they are very beneficial to learning the game of golf. If you start with good fundamentals and principles, this will help set you in the longer term to become a better golf player. Grip the club creating connection! It is essential you grip your golf club properly, as this will affect the impact on the golf balls trajectory and flight. When it comes to golf swing basics, the correct grip is extremely important to help you square the club head to the golf ball. Choosing the right grip can stop elbow pain developing. Grip size Generally golf clubs are fitted with a standard size grip. Getting fitted for your clubs really helps, as there are many sizes and thicknesses of grip available to make it more comfortable. In most cases the standard grips are suitable for golfers with smaller hands. Golfers who have larger hands often require midsize grips or more layers of tape under the grip. The golf grip involves two parts. The upper hand, or lead hand, is placed higher at the end of the grip handle, then your lower hand or trailing hand is placed under to add to the grip. Many golfers have an overlapping grip either using an interlock or Vardon grip. This will help the hands work together in the swing. There are three different strengths of golf grip 1 The neutral grip To set up a neutral grip start by positioning your club face square to the ball at address aiming at your target. Position your lead hand on the grip and ensure that only two knuckles of the lead hand are visible, being the index finger and middle finger. Then position your trail hand below your lead hand and ensure that only the knuckles of the index finger and the middle finger of the trail hand are visible. 2 The strong grip Setting up with a stronger grip promotes a closed club face through impact, this will result in a draw or hook of your golf ball, due to your hands turning over more through impact. By placing your leading hand on the grip, allowing the ring finger to become visible together with the two knuckles of the trail hand. This will give you a stronger grip at address. 3 The weak grip Setting up for a weak grip is the opposite of a strong grip, where the lead hand leans more toward the non-dominant side. This results in only the index knuckle being visible at address, promoting an open club face at impact producing a fade or slice ball trajectory. Golf Swing Planes What is golf swing plane? The golf swing plane is the angle and path created by your club as it travels in to your back swing from the address position, reaching the top of your backswing and then back through the ball to your follow through position. There are two types of swing, the One-Plane and Two-Plane swing One-plane The one plane golf swing can be a preferred choice, as this technique is simple and requires less timing to be accurate. It allows for a more shallow swing plane around the body, this enables better players who are looking to draw the ball more in their swing. The plane at the address remains the same throughout the entire swing, making the swing easier to repeat. The one plane swing is good for players that have good upper body flexibility and strong recoil. Many top modern golf professionals have changed towards one plane swings, as they have specific golf strength and flexibility, allowing this type of motion. Two-plane The two-plane swing is more complicated and steeper than the one-plane swing. The backswing is much more upright, and then by dropping your hands during the transition phase, the downswing becomes a much flatter plane. This type of swing is also characterised by the lead arm swinging upwards to be in a more upright position, than the shoulders at the top of the swing. The two-plane swing helps promote an increase in swing speed and distance. To swing a golf club like this is more suited to players that may not be as flexible, but they have excellent timing and rhythm in their golf swing. Refine the best golf posture Posture is a key fundamental and one of the golf swing basics of creating a solid golf swing. Getting yourself into optimal golf posture is crucial in your setup, when you are addressing the golf ball. Your swing relies on a consistent and solid foundation being retained this helps you deliver a solid strike of the golf ball. It is really important to develop your golf posture by adopting an athletic position and aligning your body parallel to the target line for straighter and more accurate golf shots. Let your body hinge forward at your hips and keep knees slightly bent, arms naturally fall down to your sides, before bringing in to grip your club in a relaxed manner and position. Your final golf posture should feel comfortable, relaxed and prepared for movement to swing a golf club. Good body alignment In golf, you need to be precise where you are aiming and to be accurate. It is really important to set yourself, so you know where you want the ball to start before you can hit many good golf shots. When addressing the ball, it is really important to establish your target line, making sure your left foot and right foot are aligned towards your target. As your upper body tilts forward, it is important to keep your knees bent, let your shoulders match your foot line', 'setup, when you are addressing the golf ball.

As your upper body tilts forward, it is important to keep your knees bent, let your shoulders match your foot line aiming at the target line. Always check your alignment as you set up. Try to think of an imaginary line passing from your back shoulder to front shoulder, and another line from left foot to right foot, pointing directly at your target. This is referred to as keeping your alignment square to target. An easy way to check your alignment at the golf course, get into your golf stance and place a golf club on the practice ground teeing area, ensuring it runs along the tips of your toes. Then take a step back from the golf club and look at the direction the club shaft is pointing. Ideally it should be pointed either directly at your target or slightly left. Ball position The position of your golf ball actually changes depending on which club you are using. The reason we move this position to swing a golf club is that we want to achieve optimal impact position and launch conditions. Ball position is changed to swing a golf club to achieve the best ball flight for the club in hand. The longer the club, the further forward the ball position.

Many golfers are in search of the perfect golf swing. As a golf coach and biomechanist, I’m sad to inform you that one perfect golf swing does not exist. However, the science suggests great golfers’ swings do have many things in common.

In this article we’ll cover a quick overview of what we mean when we say a perfect golf swing, we’ll then dive into swing mechanics that great golfers exhibit. To summarise we’ll then discuss what this means for your golf game. Grab a coffee and have a read, or use the table of contents below to jump to your preferred section.

This article is a little geeky so if you want a simpler guide check out this guide on how to swing a golf club or this piece for some great golf swing tips.

The perfect golf swing maximises performance not positions

Below we have four golfers who have made it to men’s world #1 – it is quite evident their golf swings all look different. What they have in common is what their golf swings provide. Their golf swings all deliver the following qualities:

High levels of shot accuracy.

High levels of repeatability in shot outcome.

Good ability to generate shot distance.

Adaptability of ball flight trajectory.

Keep them free from injury (most of the time).

Positions are not what all great golf swings have in common.

With this in mind we know our quest for the perfect golf swing is an action that delivers performance rather than textbook positions. This also hints at something we’ll discuss later on – forces are what really count in the golf swing.

Below we’ll run through the science of great golf swing mechanics phase by phase:

Backswing mechanics

Lower body swing mechanics

Despite modern-day players showing less lateral movement during their backswing, they still transfer most of their weight onto their back foot (65 – 85%). Like any throwing action this allows the player to push off through their back foot during the downswing and begin to effectively unwind their body towards the target.

What has changed in modern times is how the legs and pelvis move to create this loading during the backswing.

This video has been embedded from Michael John Field’s Youtube Channel go check it out and subscribe for more great videos.

Historically, the back knee would extend (straighten) and the front knee flexed. Meaning, when you look face-on at a golfer, the right hip would appear higher than the left, and the left leg appeared to fold inwards. This move allowed the pelvis to rotate more freely away from the target, creating a long backswing, but without effectively storing potential energy.

Modern golf swing mechanics often prefer players to maintain flex in their right knee, and have far less displacement in the position of their left leg from setup. This creates a picture from face on where the left and right hips appear more level. There is also a greater focus on players maintaining their posture (left and right hip flexion) as they reach the top of their swing – the rationale for these positions is to maximise our use of the stretch-shortening cycle.

The stretch-shortening cycle underpins many athletic movements, including the golf swing. Essentially, if we stretch a muscle group before we maximally contract it, we can generate more force. In some cases up to 60% more force. We used to think this was purely due to the stored mechanical energy, like stretching an elastic band, but nowadays we know the process is far more complicated (lots or neural stuff).

If we retain our right knee flexion throughout our backswing, we keep the quadriceps in a lengthened state, our hamstrings and gluteals are also lengthened when we maintain hip flexion (maintaining posture). All of the muscle groups above are further lengthened as the pelvis rotates away from the target during the backswing.

These swing mechanics are shown brilliantly above by Rory McIlroy. They have the effect of pre-loading large muscle groups in the lower body, ready to generate some serious speed in the downswing.

Individual differences in hip rotation

10 – 15 years ago there was a strong school of thought that the hips should be restricted from rotating during the backswing, in order to increase the separation between the pelvis and upper body. This concept has some merit, but can increase the risk of injury, and actually reduces the stretch-shortening benefits in the lower body detailed above.

Today, an increasing number of golf coaches are advising more hip rotation during the backswing, thankfully (‘getting deep into your right hip’ is the hot phrase I’ve heard used to describe this move). As your pelvis rotates posteriorly you should feel your weight shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot.

The optimal swing position to achieve this effect will vary for every golfer. Size, range of motion, strength, flexibility and tendon stiffness will all play a role. It is important for coaches and players to aim for an optimal mechanistic backswing for each player, not merely placing each player into the same position.

Key takeaway

Use your lower body to create a subtle, but powerful backswing position. Think less about textbook pictures and more about the dynamics of your golf swing.

Upper body swing mechanics

As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this.

As coaches, we often talk about shoulder rotation, but what we are actually looking at is the separation between the pelvis and thorax – known as thoracic rotation. This movement comes mainly from 12 vertebrae in the mid-section of your spine. The rotation is a result of many muscles around your mid-section contracting and relaxing in harmony.

A fundamental requirement for great upper body rotation is having a great posture at set-up. A hunched posture prevents your thoracic spine rotating, and adds extra load onto your lower back (lumbar spine), which isn’t designed to rotate in the same way. This is a common cause of injury in many golfers suffering from lower back pain.

A common misconception I would like to cover is how much thoracic rotation elite players exhibit during their backswing. Many amateurs believe elite players achieve 90 degrees of rotation, but when you model the golf swing in 3D and take the pelvis rotation into account elite players actually create, on average, 70 ± 20 degrees of rotation between their pelvis and thorax. Using some simple stats we can infer that 68% of elite players achieve somewhere between 50 to 90 degrees of thoracic rotation – far less than you might imagine. The rest of that rotation you see comes from internal and external hip rotation.

Key takeaways

Great posture at set-up is a must for great upper body swing mechanics. Elite players create 50 – 90 degrees of thoracic rotation, the rest comes from hip rotation. Try not to create more thoracic rotation than you are capable of, it isn’t necessary. Secondly, value how important hip rotation is in the modern golf swing. Look after and strengthen your hips – to do so you can check out this article for more ideas on improving strength and mobility in your hips.

Shoulders, arms and wrist mechanics

As your lower body and trunk are priming for force generation, your arms and wrists are predominantly determining what direction you launch that golf ball. As long as you strike the centre of the club face, accuracy is a product of your swing path and club face through impact.

During your backswing, both your shoulders and forearms rotate as your right elbow flexes, these actions keep the golf club arcing around your body. The more rotation from your shoulders and forearms, the flatter the shaft angle and more laid off the club will appear at the top of the backswing. The exact contribution of rotation from 1) shoulder rotation and 2) pronation/supination of the forearm is not clear – it is tricky to measure, even with 3D equipment. We can assume elite players show some variance in this area, as I’ll talk about later in this article.

Suggesting how the arm swing mechanics discussed above affect impact is not a straight forward debate. It will depend on pelvis, trunk mechanics and inertia forces of the arms and club as they reach the top of the backswing. But simply speaking, the more the arms rotate, and the more the club is laid off, the easier it is to create an in-to-out swing path. Less arm rotation creates a steeper shaft angle and an across the line position, which likely results in a more out-to-in swing path.

Wrist mechanics in the backswing

Wrist mechanics play two key roles during the backswing. Firstly, radial deviation creates a powerful lever system between the arms and the club, commonly called wrist hinge. Secondly, wrist flexion/extension manages the relationship between the club face angle and the arms. The third range of motion (pronation/supination) actually comes from the forearm and was discussed in the previous section. If you want to learn more about the wrist flexion/extension of elite players you can see a couple of the swing drills Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood use here.

Many beginner golfers struggle to create effective wrist mechanics, with the root cause commonly being a poor golf grip. If the golf club is gripped too close to the wrist joint in the left hand (near the centre of the palm), the left wrist becomes flexed at set-up to help square the clubface to the target. This position limits radial-ulna deviation (wrist hinge) resulting in golfers forcing the wrist to do something it isn’t primed to do. The first port of call in resolving poor wrist mechanics is to master your golf grip.

As the image below shows, elite golfers also show great variance in wrist mechanics during the backswing. The club face angle we see at the top of the backswing is a product of a player’s golf grip at set-up and their wrist flexion/extension at the top of the swing (we normally just look at the left wrist angle for simplicity).

The weaker the golf grip and the more extended the left wrist, the more open the club face will be relative to the body motion – generally leading to more fades and slices. The stronger the grip at set-up and the more flexed the left wrist, the more closed the club face will be (see DJ above), leading to more draws and hooks.

There is no ideal relationship or perfect club face angle in practice. A player’s optimal club face position needs to be married into a players release characteristics and desired ball flight.

Variability in golf swing mechanics

The arms and wrists contain many degrees of freedom, meaning we often see trial-to-trial variance that is much higher in the arms and wrists than in the trunk. We often think of variability as a bad thing in the golf swing, and yes, elite tour pros are far less variable than a 20 handicapper when it comes to swing-to-swing variance. But more recent research is starting to suggest elite players also show more functional variance in their golf swing mechanics.

From this perspective, elite players are more capable of returning the club head back to their ideal impact position from many different backswing positions. Less-elite players may show similar levels of variability in their backswing positions, but are not able to generate an ideal impact position from all of these permutations.

Downswing mechanics

Onto the downswing. As with the previous section, I’m not going to pretend I have the secrets to the perfect downswing. Instead, we’ll discuss the key movements and I’ll do my best to explain the science behind why these movements are important. We begin with the the ground reaction forces that cause the movements we see.

Ground reaction forces & golf swing mechanics

All successful striking actions (golf, tennis, baseball) start from the ground. If this seems counterintuitive, just go find your nearest ice rink and see how you fair hitting a driver. Ground reaction forces (GRF) are the forces that result from us pushing against the ground. We push against the ground and an equal, and opposing, force pushes back up into our body – this force initiates a lot of the movement we see in the golf swing.

Ground reaction forces are invisible without the use of a force plate (blue arrows in the images above), which makes wrapping your head around them quite tough. But trust me, they are always there and they are fundamental to great golf swing mechanics.

Research has consistently shown elite golfers generate higher levels of vertical GRF (pushing down), relative to their body weight, early-to-midway in their downswing. This makes good sense – as higher forces lead to greater acceleration of objects (F = m.a).

However, more recent research has looked into anterior-posterior (forward-back) and medial-lateral (sideways) forces. Elite players also generate greater anterior-posterior forces (one foot pushing forward, the other pushing back) during the start of their downswing. These forces are potentially more interesting, as they create torque in the lower body, and cause the pelvis to rotate towards the target. The bigger these forces, over a longer period of time (greater impulse), will lead to a greater rotational acceleration of the pelvis – Rory McIlroy’s pelvis rotation comes to mind.

Key takeaway

To create a powerful golf swing you need to be able to apply large forces into the ground – downwards, in order to create friction, but more importantly, pushing backwards with your front leg and forwards with your trail leg.

Conditioning will play an important role, but also consider players squatting motion at the start of your downswing. Optimal flexion in the hips and knees will differ from player to player, but each individual will have a sweet spot for applying larger ground reaction forces.

Body swing mechanics during the downswing

The most well known aspect of golf swing mechanics is the beautiful sequence we see Tiger portraying below:

A slight shift of weight Rotation of the pelvis Rotation of the thorax Rotation of the shoulders, forearms and ulnar deviation (release)

This is known as a kinematic sequence (sequence of movements) and it takes advantage of the summation of speed principle, where energy is generated in one segment, before being passed onto the next (pelvis > thorax > arms > club). The stretch-shortening cycle discussed in the backswing section is a key mechanism underpinning this sequence and how much additional energy can be passed on from one section to the next.

If this sequence can be well-timed, it results in each body segment generating a higher speed than the last, with peak club head velocity being achieved close to impact.

Figure showing the kinematic sequence of an elite player. The dotted lines represent swing events: Start of swing, 1/2 way back, top of backswing, 1/2 way down and impact. Minus numbers represent rotation away from the target, positive numbers represent rotational velocity towards the target.

Why amateurs struggle with this sequence

For many golfers this sequence is the holy grail, but most struggle – why they struggle is the million-dollar question. Recently, there has been a trend to fix physical limitations and there is no doubt that reduced mobility, stability and strength may inhibit golfers from achieving this sequence.

I’m not going to disagree, but here I would like golfers to realise that this sequence starts with ground reaction forces. Too many players try to mimic pelvis rotations of great players, when in fact great players show these movements as a consequence of the forces applied through their feet into the ground. Start with you feet and apply forces – the rest will follow.

Elite golf swing mechanics and sequencing

Although all professionals show similar patterns in their sequencing, there is no magical formula – just look at the videos of Rory, Brooks and Tiger in this article, they all vary; even to the naked eye. Elite players find a unique solution that helps them generate high club head speed whilst controlling the club head orientation through impact.

Nonetheless, there are some clear differences between elite and amateur players. Elite players show greater levels of rotational pelvis acceleration early on in the downswing, they then show a deceleration as they reach impact. This sounds counterintuitive but results in more energy being transferred to the thorax (see the image above). The second effect is that the pelvis is now rotating slower through impact (remember deceleration doesn’t mean zero velocity), potentially offering more control during this critical time.

Key takeaway

A great kinematic sequence starts from the ground, not the pelvis. Executed correctly, the pelvis reaches its peak angular velocity early on in the downswing, before slowing, not stopping, as it continues through impact.

Body swing mechanics moving towards impact

There is one more area of swing mechanics that falls outside current biomechanics research and falls more into the realm of modern coaching. I think it’s interesting to talk about, so I’ve discussed this briefly below.

In the 1960s and 1970s great players showed a lot of lateral movement as they moved into impact, caused by lateral joint actions at the ankle, hip and spine. These days we see a very different motion through impact, where players have far less lateral action and more rotation. Here we will discuss the lower body mechanics specific to this modern approach.

Again, credit to B Slingzz Youtube Channel where these screenshots captured from.

As discussed previously, modern golfers rotate their pelvis aggressively early on in the downswing, the pelvis quickly returns to its position at set-up and begins to rotate towards the target. It has passed on its energy, but if it stops rotating completely it will spark off a chain reaction that prevents many good ball strikers from becoming exceptional.

If the pelvis stops completely before impact, the thorax and arms will abruptly slow down too. The club head has been aggressively accelerating and cannot be slowed down. The consequence is the club head carries on and we see a breakdown between the angle of the club and left arm. This results in limited control of where the club face points through impact. We often see players hands flip over as they struggle with wild hooks.

To prevent this from happening the lower body creates some nifty adaptations. Near to impact, elite players continue to apply force to the ground through their back foot. Their right hip extends through impact, which forces the pelvis to keep turning. Many elite players also extend the left knee and hip slightly through the hitting zone, which gives the left side of the body more capacity to rotate and keeps the pelvis moving. This is demonstrated beautifully by Tiger Woods in the sequence above. The visual result is a solid left side, with the rest of the body rotating about the left leg.

Key takeaway

Great lower body action is the key to mastering club face control and accuracy through impact. The right side pushes, as the left side affords room for the pelvis to keep rotating. A great golf coach will make subtle changes to your posture, stance and weight distribution to help you find your solution.

Release and arms mechanics

How the arms and wrists move in an elite player is an under-researched topic in biomechanics and can still divide coaches. Some golfers incorrectly assume the arms do nothing during the downswing, they merely follow great body motion, but I would disagree. Personally, I feel great arm mechanics can elevate a player considerably once they have sound body mechanics in place.

A scroll back up to Tiger’s swing sequence will show you that early on in the downswing the left shoulder horizontally extends, bringing the club back in front of the chest. Many golfers including Tiger and Justin Rose talk about their arms falling down before they rotate their body through. Whereas amateur players often feel their body needs to do all the work whilst their arms stay passive.

This is the difference between feeling and doing in golf. The perfect golf swing is a blend of body rotation and arm swing. Most golfers have one aspect that lags behind the other and often requires extra attention.

If the downswing is started correctly you’ll get to a position similar to Rory and Tiger below. You can call this ‘the slot’ or pre-impact but it is a position where the club face and body is primed to deliver the club into impact.

Most golfers exhibit similar positions as we get closer to impact, but not identical. However, two different looking positions could produce almost identical forces at impact.

This is the position where all professional players look very similar, not identical. You need to be roughly in this position to deliver the club squarely and powerfully, but your perfect position will depend on your body mechanics, club face angle and the shot shape you wish to hit.

Let us look at what great players do from here, this is worth sharing.

The difference between amateurs and elite players swing mechanics

Once the club falls back down parallel to the ground we great players rotate to square the club face up at impact. The forces created by the summation of speed automatically cause the release of any wrist hinge into impact (ulnar deviation).

This area of swing mechanics is potentially the most misunderstood by amateur golfers. Amateur players often feel they have to use their wrists to square up the club face. However, when you look through all of the swings featured in this article, you’ll notice elite players show minimal changes in wrist flexion/extension. The club face is controlled through body rotation and pronation and supination in the forearms.

If there is anything close to a secret to the perfect golf swing, it is understanding this relationship between the arms and how they control the club face rotation during your golf swing.

Great golfers get into the position above then use the body and arms to rotate through impact – there is very little active hand action.

Key takeaway

The arms play an important role in your downswing mechanics. Becoming an exceptional ball striker requires getting to grips with how body rotation and pronation/supination control your club face during your downswing and through impact.

Building your perfect golf swing

So what does this mean for your golf game? In this article, I wanted to share the detail – the biomechanics behind the perfect golf swing. Hopefully, the understanding has helped you build an idea of what great golf swings look and feel like.

However, playing golf is different to the theory. Below is my summary of what I feel golfers should take away to become better players:

Your backswing should involve a turn and a shift of weight – what that looks like depends on your body type. Develop a golf grip, arm swing and left wrist position that sets the club face in a neutral position.

Start your downswing with a blend of body rotation and arm swing – what this will feel like depends on you and what is currently too active. Half way down you should have the club set in a position not identical, but closely resembling great players – pay particular attention to your club face angle at this point. 2 – 3º makes a large difference in accuracy.

From here the move through impact is mainly body rotation and some arm movement. Great players pre-set everything before impact and rotate through using their big muscles.

Finally, don’t loose sight of the end goal. Your aim is not to have a textbook looking swing, but rather to find a motion that hits the ball straight, is repeatable and keeps you free from injury.

In some cases up to 60 more force. We used to think this was purely due to the stored mechanical energy, like stretching an elastic band, but nowadays we know the process is far more complicated lots or neural stuff. If we retain our right knee flexion throughout our backswing, we keep the quadriceps in a lengthened state, our hamstrings and gluteals are also lengthened when we maintain hip flexion maintaining posture.

Today, an increasing number of golf coaches are advising more hip rotation during the backswing, thankfully getting deep into your right hip is the hot phrase Ive heard used to describe this move. As your pelvis rotates posteriorly you should feel your weight shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot. The optimal swing position to achieve this effect will vary for every golfer. Size, range of motion, strength, flexibility and tendon stiffness will all play a role. It is important for coaches and players to aim for an optimal mechanistic backswing for each player, not merely placing each player into the same position. Key takeaway Use your lower body to create a subtle, but powerful backswing position. Think less about textbook pictures and more about the dynamics of your golf swing. Upper body swing mechanics As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this.

Using some simple stats we can infer that 68 of elite players achieve somewhere between 50 to 90 degrees of thoracic rotation  far less than you might imagine. The rest of that rotation you see comes from internal and external hip rotation. Key takeaways Great posture at set-up is a must for great upper body swing mechanics. Elite players create 50  90 degrees of thoracic rotation, the rest comes from hip rotation. Try not to create more thoracic rotation than you are capable of, it isnt necessary.

Body swing mechanics during the downswing The most well known aspect of golf swing mechanics is the beautiful sequence we see Tiger portraying below A slight shift of weight Rotation of the pelvis Rotation of the thorax Rotation of the shoulders, forearms and ulnar deviation release This is known as a kinematic sequence sequence of movements and it takes advantage of the summation of speed principle, where energy is generated in one segment, before being passed onto the next pelvis  thorax  arms  club. The stretch-shortening cycle discussed in the backswing section is a key mechanism underpinning this sequence and how much additional energy can be passed on from one section to the next. If this sequence can be well-timed, it results in each body segment generating a higher speed than the last, with peak club head velocity being achieved close to impact. Figure showing the kinematic sequence of an elite player. The dotted lines represent swing events Start of swing, 12 way back, top of backswing, 12 way down and impact. Minus numbers represent rotation away from the target, positive numbers represent rotational velocity towards the target. Why amateurs struggle with this sequence For many golfers this sequence is the holy grail, but most struggle  why they struggle is the million-dollar question. Recently, there has been a trend to fix physical limitations and there is no doubt that reduced mobility, stability and strength may inhibit golfers from achieving this sequence. Im not going to disagree, but here I would like golfers to realise that this sequence starts with ground reaction forces. Too many players try to mimic pelvis rotations of great players, when in fact great players show these movements as a consequence of the forces applied through their feet into the ground. Start with you feet and apply forces  the rest will follow. Elite golf swing mechanics and sequencing Although all professionals show similar patterns in their sequencing, there is no magical formula  just look at the videos of Rory, Brooks and Tiger in this article, they all vary even to the naked eye. Elite players find a unique solution that helps them generate high club head speed whilst controlling the club head orientation through impact. Nonetheless, there are some clear differences between elite and amateur players. Elite players show greater levels of rotational pelvis acceleration early on in the downswing, they then show a deceleration as they reach impact. This sounds counterintuitive but results in more energy being transferred to the thorax see the image above. The second effect is that the pelvis is now rotating slower through impact remember deceleration doesnt mean zero velocity, potentially offering more control during this critical time. Key takeaway A great kinematic sequence starts from the ground, not the pelvis. Executed correctly, the pelvis reaches its peak angular velocity early on in the downswing, before slowing, not stopping, as it continues through impact. Body swing mechanics moving towards impact There is one more area of swing mechanics that falls outside current biomechanics research and falls more into the realm of modern coaching. I think its interesting to talk about, so Ive discussed this briefly below. In the 1960s and 1970s great players showed a lot of lateral movement as they moved into impact, caused by lateral joint actions at the ankle, hip and spine. These days we see a very different motion through impact, where players have far less lateral action and more rotation. Here we will discuss the lower body mechanics specific to this modern approach. Again, credit to B Slingzz Youtube Channel where these screenshots captured from. As discussed previously, modern golfers rotate their pelvis aggressively early on in the downswing, the pelvis quickly returns to its position at set-up and begins to rotate towards the target. It has passed on its energy, but if it stops rotating completely it will spark off a chain reaction that prevents many good ball strikers from becoming exceptional. If the pelvis stops completely before impact, the thorax and arms will abruptly slow down too. The club head has been aggressively accelerating and cannot be slowed down. The consequence is the club head carries on and we see a breakdown between the angle of the club and left arm. This results in limited control of where the club face points through impact. We often see players hands flip over as they struggle with wild hooks. To prevent this from happening the lower body creates some nifty adaptations. Near to impact, elite players continue to apply force to the ground through their back foot. Their right hip extends through impact, which forces the pelvis to keep turning. Many elite players also extend the left knee and hip slightly through the hitting zone, which gives the left side of the body more capacity to rotate and keeps the pelvis moving. This is demonstrated beautifully by Tiger Woods in the sequence above. The visual result is a solid left side, with the rest of the body rotating about the left leg. Key takeaway Great lower body action is the key to mastering club face control and accuracy through impact. The right side pushes, as the left side affords room for the pelvis to keep rotating. A great golf coach will make subtle changes to your posture, stance and weight distribution to help you find your solution. Release and arms mechanics How the arms and wrists move in an elite player is an under-researched topic in biomechanics and can still divide coaches. Some golfers incorrectly assume the arms do nothing during the downswing, they merely follow great body motion, but I would disagree. Personally, I feel great arm mechanics can elevate a player considerably once they have sound body mechanics in place. A scroll back up to Tigers swing sequence will show you that early on in the downswing the left shoulder horizontally extends, bringing the club back in front of the chest. Many golfers including Tiger and Justin Rose talk about their arms falling down before they rotate their body through. Whereas amateur players often feel their body needs to do all the work whilst their arms stay passive. This is the difference between feeling and doing in golf. The perfect golf swing is a blend of body rotation and arm swing. Most golfers have one aspect that lags behind the other and often requires extra attention. If the downswing is started correctly youll get to a position similar to Rory and Tiger below. You can call this the slot or pre-impact but it is a position where the club face and body is primed to deliver the club into impact. Most golfers exhibit similar positions as we get closer to impact, but not identical. However, two different looking positions could produce almost identical forces at impact. This is the position where all professional players look very similar, not identical. You need to be roughly in this position to deliver the club squarely and powerfully, but your perfect position will depend on your body mechanics, club face angle and the shot shape you wish to hit. Let us look at what great players do from here, this is worth sharing. The difference between amateurs and elite players swing mechanics Once the club falls back down parallel to the ground we great players rotate to square the club face up at impact. The forces created by the summation of speed automatically cause the release of any wrist hinge into impact ulnar deviation. This area of swing mechanics is potentially the most misunderstood by amateur golfers. Amateur players often feel they have to use their wrists to square up the club face. However, when you look through all of the swings featured in this article, youll notice elite players show minimal changes in wrist flexionextension. The club face is controlled through body rotation and pronation and supination in the forearms. If there is anything close to a secret to the perfect golf swing, it is understanding this relationship between the arms and how they control the club face rotation during your golf swing. Great golfers get into the position above then use the body and arms to rotate through impact  there is very little active hand action. Key takeaway The arms play an important role in your downswing mechanics. Becoming an exceptional ball striker requires getting to grips with how body rotation and pronationsupination control your club face during your downswing and through impact. Building your perfect golf swing So what does this mean for your golf game? In this article, I wanted to share the detail  the biomechanics behind the perfect golf swing. Hopefully, the understanding has helped you build an idea of what great golf swings look and feel like. However, playing golf is different to the theory. Below is my summary of what I feel golfers should take away to become better players Your backswing should involve a turn and a shift of weight  what that looks like depends on your body type. Develop a golf grip, arm swing and left wrist position that sets the club face in a neutral position. Start your downswing with a blend of body rotation and arm swing  what this will feel like depends on you and what is currently too active. Half way down you should have the club set in a position not identical, but closely resembling great players  pay particular attention to your club face angle at this point. 2  3º makes a large difference in accuracy. From here the move through impact is mainly body rotation and some arm movement. Great players pre-set everything before impact and rotate through using their big muscles. Finally, dont loose sight of the end goal. Your aim is not to have a textbook looking swing, but rather to find a motion that hits the ball straight, is repeatable and keeps you free from injury.

However, the science suggests great golfers swings do have many things in common. In this article well cover a quick overview of what we mean when we say a perfect golf swing, well then dive into swing mechanics that great golfers exhibit. To summarise well then discuss what this means for your golf game. Grab a coffee and have a read, or use the table of contents below to jump to your preferred section. This article is a little geeky so if you want a simpler guide check out this guide on how to swing a golf club or this piece for some great golf swing tips. The perfect golf swing maximises performance not positions Below we have four golfers who have made it to mens world 1 it is quite evident their golf swings all look different. What they have in common is what their golf swings provide. Their golf swings all deliver the following qualities High levels of shot accuracy. High levels of repeatability in shot outcome. Good ability to generate shot distance. Adaptability of ball flight trajectory. Keep them free from injury most of the time. Positions are not what all great golf swings have in common. With this in mind we know our quest for the perfect golf swing is an action that delivers performance rather than textbook positions. This also hints at something well discuss later on forces are what really count in the golf swing. Below well run through the science of great golf swing mechanics phase by phase Backswing mechanics Lower body swing mechanics Despite modern-day players showing less lateral movement during their backswing, they still transfer most of their weight onto their back foot 65 85. Like any throwing action this allows the player to push off through their back foot during the downswing and begin to effectively unwind their body towards the target. What has changed in modern times is how the legs and pelvis move to create this loading during the backswing. This video has been embedded from Michael John Fields Youtube Channel go check it out and subscribe for more great videos. Historically, the back knee would extend straighten and the front knee flexed. Meaning, when you look face-on at a golfer, the right hip would appear higher than the left, and the left leg appeared to fold inwards. This move allowed the pelvis to rotate more freely away from the target, creating a long backswing, but without effectively storing potential energy. Modern golf swing mechanics often prefer players to maintain flex in their right knee, and have far less displacement in the position of their left leg from setup. This creates a picture from face on where the left and right hips appear more level. There is also a greater focus on players maintaining their posture left and right hip flexion as they reach the top of their swing the rationale for these positions is to maximise our use of the stretch-shortening cycle. The stretch-shortening cycle underpins many athletic movements, including the golf swing. Essentially, if we stretch a muscle group before we maximally contract it, we can generate more force. In some cases up to 60 more force. We used to think this was purely due to the stored mechanical energy, like stretching an elastic band, but nowadays we know the process is far more complicated lots or neural stuff. If we retain our right knee flexion throughout our backswing, we keep the quadriceps in a lengthened state, our hamstrings and gluteals are also lengthened when we maintain hip flexion maintaining posture. All of the muscle groups above are further lengthened as the pelvis rotates away from the target during the backswing. These swing mechanics are shown brilliantly above by Rory McIlroy. They have the effect of pre-loading large muscle groups in the lower body, ready to generate some serious speed in the downswing. Individual differences in hip rotation 10 15 years ago there was a strong school of thought that the hips should be restricted from rotating during the backswing, in order to increase the separation between the pelvis and upper body. This concept has some merit, but can increase the risk of injury, and actually reduces the stretch-shortening benefits in the lower body detailed above. Today, an increasing number of golf coaches are advising more hip rotation during the backswing, thankfully getting deep into your right hip is the hot phrase Ive heard used to describe this move. As your pelvis rotates posteriorly you should feel your weight shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot. The optimal swing position to achieve this effect will vary for every golfer. Size, range of motion, strength, flexibility and tendon stiffness will all play a role. It is important for coaches and players to aim for an optimal mechanistic backswing for each player, not merely placing each player into the same position. Key takeaway Use your lower body to create a subtle, but powerful backswing position. Think less about textbook pictures and more about the dynamics of your golf swing. Upper body swing mechanics As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this. As coaches, we often talk about shoulder rotation, but what we are actually looking at is the separation between the pelvis and thorax known as thoracic rotation. This movement comes mainly from 12 vertebrae in the mid-section of your spine. The rotation is a result of many muscles around your mid-section contracting and relaxing in harmony. A fundamental requirement for great upper body rotation is having a great posture at set-up. A hunched posture', 'shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot.

Upper body swing mechanics As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this. As coaches, we often talk about shoulder rotation, but what we are actually looking at is the separation between the pelvis and thorax known as thoracic rotation. This movement comes mainly from 12 vertebrae in the mid-section of your spine. The rotation is a result of many muscles around your mid-section contracting and relaxing in harmony. A fundamental requirement for great upper body rotation is having a great posture at set-up. A hunched posture prevents your thoracic spine rotating, and adds extra load onto your lower back lumbar spine, which isnt designed to rotate in the same way. This is a common cause of injury in many golfers suffering from lower back pain. A common misconception I would like to cover is how much thoracic rotation elite players exhibit during their backswing. Many amateurs believe elite players achieve 90 degrees of rotation, but when you model the golf swing in 3D and take the pelvis rotation into account elite players actually create, on average, 70 20 degrees of rotation between their pelvis and thorax. Using some simple stats we can infer that 68 of elite players achieve somewhere between 50 to 90 degrees of thoracic rotation far less than you might imagine. The rest of that rotation you see comes from internal and external hip rotation. Key takeaways Great posture at set-up is a must for great upper body swing mechanics. Elite players create 50 90 degrees of thoracic rotation, the rest comes from hip rotation. Try not to create more thoracic rotation than you are capable of, it isnt necessary. Secondly, value how important hip rotation is in the modern golf swing. Look after and strengthen your hips to do so you can check out this article for more ideas on improving strength and mobility in your hips. Shoulders, arms and wrist mechanics As your lower body and trunk are priming for force generation, your arms and wrists are predominantly determining what direction you launch that golf ball. As long as you strike the centre of the club face, accuracy is a product of your swing path and club face through impact. During your backswing, both your shoulders and forearms rotate as your right elbow flexes, these actions keep the golf club arcing around your body. The more rotation from your shoulders and forearms, the flatter the shaft angle and more laid off the club will appear at the top of the backswing. The exact contribution of rotation from 1 shoulder rotation and 2 pronationsupination of the forearm is not clear it is tricky to measure, even with 3D equipment. We can assume elite players show some variance in this area, as Ill talk about later in this article. Suggesting how the arm swing mechanics discussed above affect impact is not a straight forward debate. It will depend on pelvis, trunk mechanics and inertia forces of the arms and club as they reach the top of the backswing. But simply speaking, the more the arms rotate, and the more the club is laid off, the easier it is to create an in-to-out swing path. Less arm rotation creates a steeper shaft angle and an across the line position, which likely results in a more out-to-in swing path. Wrist mechanics in the backswing Wrist mechanics play two key roles during the backswing. Firstly, radial deviation creates a powerful lever system between the arms and the club, commonly called wrist hinge. Secondly, wrist flexionextension manages the relationship between the club face angle and the arms. The third range of motion pronationsupination actually comes from the forearm and was discussed in the previous section. If you want to learn more about the wrist flexionextension of elite players you can see a couple of the swing drills Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood use here. Many beginner golfers struggle to create effective wrist mechanics, with the root cause commonly being a poor golf grip. If the golf club is gripped too close to the wrist joint in the left hand near the centre of the palm, the left wrist becomes flexed at set-up to help square the clubface to the target. This position limits radial-ulna deviation wrist hinge resulting in golfers forcing the wrist to do something it isnt primed to do. The first port of call in resolving poor wrist mechanics is to master your golf grip. As the image below shows, elite golfers also show great variance in wrist mechanics during the backswing. The club face angle we see at the top of the backswing is a product of a players golf grip at set-up and their wrist flexionextension at the top of the swing we normally just look at the left wrist angle for simplicity. The weaker the golf grip and the more extended the left wrist, the more open the club face will be relative to the body motion generally leading to more fades and slices. The stronger the grip at set-up and the more flexed the left wrist, the more closed the club face will be see DJ above, leading to more draws and hooks. There is no ideal relationship or perfect club face angle in practice. A players optimal club face position needs to be married into a players release characteristics and', 'wrist becomes flexed at set-up to help square the clubface to the target.

There is no ideal relationship or perfect club face angle in practice. A players optimal club face position needs to be married into a players release characteristics and desired ball flight. Variability in golf swing mechanics The arms and wrists contain many degrees of freedom, meaning we often see trial-to-trial variance that is much higher in the arms and wrists than in the trunk. We often think of variability as a bad thing in the golf swing, and yes, elite tour pros are far less variable than a 20 handicapper when it comes to swing-to-swing variance. But more recent research is starting to suggest elite players also show more functional variance in their golf swing mechanics. From this perspective, elite players are more capable of returning the club head back to their ideal impact position from many different backswing positions. Less-elite players may show similar levels of variability in their backswing positions, but are not able to generate an ideal impact position from all of these permutations. Downswing mechanics Onto the downswing. As with the previous section, Im not going to pretend I have the secrets to the perfect downswing. Instead, well discuss the key movements and Ill do my best to explain the science behind why these movements are important. We begin with the the ground reaction forces that cause the movements we see. Ground reaction forces golf swing mechanics All successful striking actions golf, tennis, baseball start from the ground. If this seems counterintuitive, just go find your nearest ice rink and see how you fair hitting a driver. Ground reaction forces GRF are the forces that result from us pushing against the ground. We push against the ground and an equal, and opposing, force pushes back up into our body this force initiates a lot of the movement we see in the golf swing. Ground reaction forces are invisible without the use of a force plate blue arrows in the images above, which makes wrapping your head around them quite tough. But trust me, they are always there and they are fundamental to great golf swing mechanics. Research has consistently shown elite golfers generate higher levels of vertical GRF pushing down, relative to their body weight, early-to-midway in their downswing. This makes good sense as higher forces lead to greater acceleration of objects F m.a. However, more recent research has looked into anterior-posterior forward-back and medial-lateral sideways forces. Elite players also generate greater anterior-posterior forces one foot pushing forward, the other pushing back during the start of their downswing. These forces are potentially more interesting, as they create torque in the lower body, and cause the pelvis to rotate towards the target. The bigger these forces, over a longer period of time greater impulse, will lead to a greater rotational acceleration of the pelvis Rory McIlroys pelvis rotation comes to mind. Key takeaway To create a powerful golf swing you need to be able to apply large forces into the ground downwards, in order to create friction, but more importantly, pushing backwards with your front leg and forwards with your trail leg. Conditioning will play an important role, but also consider players squatting motion at the start of your downswing. Optimal flexion in the hips and knees will differ from player to player, but each individual will have a sweet spot for applying larger ground reaction forces. Body swing mechanics during the downswing The most well known aspect of golf swing mechanics is the beautiful sequence we see Tiger portraying below A slight shift of weight Rotation of the pelvis Rotation of the thorax Rotation of the shoulders, forearms and ulnar deviation release This is known as a kinematic sequence sequence of movements and it takes advantage of the summation of speed principle, where energy is generated in one segment, before being passed onto the next pelvis thorax arms club.

Understanding the Fundamentals of a Golf Swing

Understanding the fundamentals of a golf swing is crucial for any golfer, whether beginner or advanced. These basics form the foundation upon which more advanced techniques are built.

By mastering the core elements listed below, golfers can achieve a more consistent and effective swing, leading to improved performance on the course.

The Grip: How to Hold the Club

The grip is the first fundamental aspect of the golf swing. Your grip on the club will significantly impact the direction and distance of the shot. There are three main types of grips: the overlapping grip, the interlocking grip, and the 10-finger grip.

Each has its pros and cons; the key is to find the one that feels the most comfortable and allows you to control the club effectively.

An overlapping grip is commonly used by golfers with larger hands. This grip involves placing the pinky finger of the trailing hand between the index and middle fingers of the lead hand.

The interlocking grip, favored by players with smaller hands, involves interlocking the pinky finger of the trailing hand with the index finger of the lead hand.

In the 10-finger grip, also known as the baseball grip, all fingers of both hands grip the club independently. This grip is often recommended for beginners or those with weak hands.

A proper grip should be firm yet relaxed. The V’s formed by the thumb and index finger of both hands should point toward your right shoulder. (Note that this guide is aimed at right-handed players; if you’re left-handed, do the opposite.)

A strong grip can lead to a closed clubface at impact, causing a hook, while a weak grip can open the clubface, leading to a slice. Practicing your grip can help you find the right balance.

The Stance: Your Position Matters

Your stance is the next crucial element. A good stance sets the foundation for a balanced and powerful swing. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between them.

Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight. This posture allows for maximum mobility and balance.

The position of the ball in your stance can also affect your shot. For a driver, ensure the ball is parallel to the inside of your left heel. For shorter irons, ensure it is in the center of your stance. This positioning helps ensure solid contact with the ball and proper trajectory.

Your stance should also be adjusted based on the type of shot you’re attempting. For example, a wider stance can provide more stability for powerful drives, while a narrower stance can offer more control for precision shots.

Consistently practicing your stance will help you develop muscle memory and improve your overall swing.

The Backswing: Starting Your Swing Right

A proper backswing sets the stage for a powerful and accurate downswing. However, the backswing is where many golfers begin to lose control.

Start by rotating your shoulders while keeping your arms straight and your wrists firm. Your weight should shift to your back foot, and your hips should rotate slightly.

A common mistake is to swing the club too far back, which can lead to a loss of balance and control. Instead, focus on a smooth, controlled motion.

Pay attention to the position of your club at the top of the backswing. It should be parallel to the ground, with the clubface pointing slightly downward. This will allow for a more efficient transition into the downswing.

Think of your backswing as a wound-up coil, storing energy that will be released in the downswing. Practicing a balanced backswing can help you achieve a more powerful and accurate shot.

Consistency in your backswing will lead to more reliable shots and better performance on the course.

The Downswing: Powering Through

The downswing is where the power and speed of your swing come into play. It begins with a shift of your weight to your front foot, followed by the rotation of your hips and shoulders. Your arms should follow naturally, with the clubhead accelerating toward the ball.

A common mistake is to use too much upper-body strength, leading to an over-the-top swing path. If you have this problem, focus on using your lower body to initiate the downswing.

This will help you maintain balance and generate more power. The key is to allow your hips and shoulders to lead, with your arms and hands following.

As you approach impact, keep your eyes on the ball and your head steady. Your wrists should release naturally, allowing the clubface to make solid contact with the ball.

A proper downswing will result in a powerful, accurate shot with a consistent trajectory.

Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Even seasoned golfers can fall into bad habits that hinder their performance. Identifying and correcting these common mistakes can lead to significant improvements in your game.

By focusing on proper technique and making small adjustments, you can avoid these pitfalls and enhance your overall swing.

Incorrect Grip: Adjusting Your Hands

An incorrect grip can lead to inconsistent shots. An overly strong or weak grip can affect the clubface at impact, causing hooks or slices. Gripping the club too tightly can lead to tension in your arms and shoulders, affecting your swing’s fluidity.

Aim for a firm yet relaxed grip. Practicing your grip regularly can help you develop muscle memory and will improve the consistency of your swing.

If you’re unsure about your grip, consider seeking feedback from a golf coach or using training aids to help you find the correct hand position. The grip is fundamental to a successful swing, so it’s worth investing time in getting it right.

Poor Posture: Finding the Right Stance

Poor posture is another common issue that can affect your swing. Slouching or standing too upright can lead to a loss of balance and control. To correct this, focus on maintaining the posture described below.

Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed. Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight.

Another crucial aspect of posture is the alignment of your body. Your shoulders, hips, and feet should be parallel to the target line. Misalignment can lead to off-target shots and inconsistency.

Practicing your stance and alignment can help you develop a more balanced and controlled swing.

If you’re struggling with your posture, consider using a mirror or recording your swing to identify any issues. Making small adjustments to your posture can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance.

Swing Path Issues: Staying on Track

Swing path issues are common, especially for beginners. An incorrect swing path can lead to slices, hooks, and inconsistent shots.

To fix this, focus on a straight and controlled swing path. Your club should travel along the target line, with the clubhead staying square to the ball.

One of the most common mistakes is an over-the-top swing, where the club moves outside the target line on the downswing. This can lead to slices and loss of power.

To correct this, focus on initiating the downswing with your lower body, allowing your hips and shoulders to lead. This will help you maintain a more controlled and efficient swing path.

As always, using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach can help you identify and correct swing path issues.

Lack of Follow-Through: Completing Your Swing

A lack of follow-through can affect the power and accuracy of your shots. Completing your swing allows for a full release of energy and ensures proper contact with the ball.

To improve your follow-through, focus on maintaining a smooth and controlled motion throughout your swing.

A common mistake is attempting to stop the swing abruptly after impact. This can lead to loss of power and control. Allow your swing to continue naturally, with your club finishing high and your body facing the target.

Practicing your follow-through can help you develop a more powerful and accurate swing.

Making small adjustments to your follow-through can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance. If you’re struggling with your follow-through, consider using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach.

Tips to Improve Your Golf Swing

Improving your golf swing requires dedication and practice. By focusing on key aspects of your swing and incorporating effective training methods, you can achieve significant improvements.

Here are some tips to help you enhance your swing and take your game to the next level.

Practicing Consistently

Consistent practice is essential for improving your golf swing. Regular practice allows you to develop muscle memory and refine your technique.

Set aside dedicated time each week to work on your swing, focusing on different aspects such as grip, stance, and follow-through. Many players like to devote one session to each aspect; others prefer to mix it up.

It’s also important to practice with a purpose. Instead of mindlessly hitting balls, set specific goals for each practice session. This could include working on your grip, improving your swing path, or increasing your swing speed.

Consider using a practice journal to track your progress and identify areas for improvement. This can help you stay focused and motivated, leading to more effective practice sessions and better results on the course.

Using Training Aids

Training aids can be valuable tools for improving your golf swing. Various aids are available, each designed to address specific aspects of the swing.

For example, grip trainers can help you develop a proper grip, while alignment sticks can assist with maintaining a correct stance and swing path.

Another useful training aid is the swing analyzer, which provides real-time feedback on your swing mechanics. This can help you identify and correct any issues, leading to more consistent and accurate shots.

Using training aids regularly can enhance your practice sessions and accelerate your progress. When selecting training aids, choose those that address your specific needs and goals. Incorporating these aids into your practice routine will help you develop better habits and improve your overall swing.

Taking Lessons From a Pro

Taking lessons from a professional golf coach can provide valuable insights and guidance. A coach can help you identify and correct any flaws in your swing, leading to more significant improvements. Additionally, a coach can provide personalized advice and drills tailored to your needs and goals.

When choosing a coach, look for someone with experience and a proven track record. Reading reviews and seeking recommendations can help you find a coach who is a good fit for you.

Taking lessons from a pro can be a worthwhile investment in your game. Consider scheduling regular lessons to maintain consistent progress. A coach can help you stay focused and motivated, leading to more effective practice sessions and better results on the course.

Analyzing Your Swing With Video

Analyzing your swing with video can provide valuable feedback and insights. Recording your swing allows you to see what you’re doing right and identify areas for improvement.

Use a smartphone or camera to record your swing from different angles, including front, side, and rear views. As you review the footage, look for issues with your grip, stance, swing path, or follow-through.

Additionally, comparing your swing to that of professional golfers can provide a benchmark for what you’re aiming to achieve.

Consider using video analysis software to enhance your review process. These tools allow you to slow down and home in on specific aspects of your swing, providing more detailed feedback.

If you’re having trouble discovering where you’re going wrong, consider enlisting the services of a golf coach.

The Role of Equipment in Your Golf Swing

The right equipment can significantly impact your golf swing and overall performance. Using clubs and balls that are suited to your needs can help you achieve better results.

Understanding the role of equipment in your swing can help you make more informed choices and optimize your game.

Choosing the Right Clubs

Choosing the right clubs is essential for achieving a consistent and effective swing. Different clubs are designed for different purposes, so it’s important to select those that match your skill level and playing style.

For example, beginners may benefit from using clubs with a larger sweet spot, while more advanced players may prefer clubs that offer greater control and precision.

When selecting clubs, consider factors such as loft, shaft length, and clubhead design. These elements can affect the trajectory, distance, and accuracy of your shots.

Additionally, having your clubs custom-fitted can ensure they are tailored to your unique swing characteristics.

Consider seeking advice from a professional club fitter or golf coach when choosing your clubs. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your needs and goals.

Importance of Proper Golf Balls

Using the right golf balls can enhance your swing and overall performance. Different golf balls are designed for different playing conditions and skill levels. For example, some balls are designed to provide greater distance, while others offer more control and spin.

When selecting golf balls, consider factors such as compression, cover material, and dimple pattern. These elements can affect the ball’s flight, feel, and performance. Additionally, using the same type of ball consistently can help you achieve more predictable results.

Experimenting with different golf balls can help you find the one that best suits your game. Consider seeking advice from a golf coach or professional when selecting your balls.

Maintenance of Your Gear

Proper maintenance of your gear is essential for achieving consistent results. Regularly cleaning your clubs and balls can help ensure they perform at their best.

Additionally, inspecting your equipment for signs of wear and tear can help you identify any issues and address them promptly.

Storing your gear properly can also help extend its lifespan. Keep your clubs in a cool, dry place and avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures.

Similarly, store your golf balls in a cool, dry place to maintain their performance characteristics.

Consider using protective covers for your clubs to prevent damage during transport. And be sure to regularly check and replace grips, as this will ensure you can maintain control over your swing.

A proper grip should be firm yet relaxed. The Vs formed by the thumb and index finger of both hands should point toward your right shoulder. Note that this guide is aimed at right-handed players if youre left-handed, do the opposite. A strong grip can lead to a closed clubface at impact, causing a hook, while a weak grip can open the clubface, leading to a slice. Practicing your grip can help you find the right balance. The Stance Your Position Matters Your stance is the next crucial element. A good stance sets the foundation for a balanced and powerful swing. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between them. Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight. This posture allows for maximum mobility and balance. The position of the ball in your stance can also affect your shot. For a driver, ensure the ball is parallel to the inside of your left heel. For shorter irons, ensure it is in the center of your stance. This positioning helps ensure solid contact with the ball and proper trajectory. Your stance should also be adjusted based on the type of shot youre attempting. For example, a wider stance can provide more stability for powerful drives, while a narrower stance can offer more control for precision shots. Consistently practicing your stance will help you develop muscle memory and improve your overall swing. The Backswing Starting Your Swing Right A proper backswing sets the stage for a powerful and accurate downswing. However, the backswing is where many golfers begin to lose control. Start by rotating your shoulders while keeping your arms straight and your wrists firm. Your weight should shift to your back foot, and your hips should rotate slightly. A common mistake is to swing the club too far back, which can lead to a loss of balance and control. Instead, focus on a smooth, controlled motion. Pay attention to the position of your club at the top of the backswing. It should be parallel to the ground, with the clubface pointing slightly downward. This will allow for a more efficient transition into the downswing. Think of your backswing as a wound-up coil, storing energy that will be released in the downswing. Practicing a balanced backswing can help you achieve a more powerful and accurate shot. Consistency in your backswing will lead to more reliable shots and better performance on the course. The Downswing Powering Through The downswing is where the power and speed of your swing come into play. It begins with a shift of your weight to your front foot, followed by the rotation of your hips and shoulders. Your arms should follow naturally, with the clubhead accelerating toward the ball. A common mistake is to use too much upper-body strength, leading to an over-the-top swing path. If you have this problem, focus on using your lower body to initiate the downswing. This will help you maintain balance and generate more power. The key is to allow your hips and shoulders to lead, with your arms and hands following. As you approach impact, keep your eyes on the ball and your head steady. Your wrists should release naturally, allowing the clubface to make solid contact with the ball. A proper downswing will result in a powerful, accurate shot with a consistent trajectory. Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them Even seasoned golfers can fall into bad habits that hinder their performance. Identifying and correcting these common mistakes can lead to significant improvements in your game. By focusing on proper technique and making small adjustments, you can avoid these pitfalls and enhance your overall swing. Incorrect Grip Adjusting Your Hands An incorrect grip can lead to inconsistent shots. An overly strong or weak grip can affect the', 'to your front foot, followed by the rotation of your hips and shoulders.

Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them Even seasoned golfers can fall into bad habits that hinder their performance. Identifying and correcting these common mistakes can lead to significant improvements in your game. By focusing on proper technique and making small adjustments, you can avoid these pitfalls and enhance your overall swing. Incorrect Grip Adjusting Your Hands An incorrect grip can lead to inconsistent shots. An overly strong or weak grip can affect the clubface at impact, causing hooks or slices. Gripping the club too tightly can lead to tension in your arms and shoulders, affecting your swings fluidity. Aim for a firm yet relaxed grip. Practicing your grip regularly can help you develop muscle memory and will improve the consistency of your swing. If youre unsure about your grip, consider seeking feedback from a golf coach or using training aids to help you find the correct hand position. The grip is fundamental to a successful swing, so its worth investing time in getting it right. Poor Posture Finding the Right Stance Poor posture is another common issue that can affect your swing. Slouching or standing too upright can lead to a loss of balance and control. To correct this, focus on maintaining the posture described below. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed. Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight. Another crucial aspect of posture is the alignment of your body. Your shoulders, hips, and feet should be parallel to the target line. Misalignment can lead to off-target shots and inconsistency. Practicing your stance and alignment can help you develop a more balanced and controlled swing. If youre struggling with your posture, consider using a mirror or recording your swing to identify any issues. Making small adjustments to your posture can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance. Swing Path Issues Staying on Track Swing path issues are common, especially for beginners. An incorrect swing path can lead to slices, hooks, and inconsistent shots. To fix this, focus on a straight and controlled swing path. Your club should travel along the target line, with the clubhead staying square to the ball. One of the most common mistakes is an over-the-top swing, where the club moves outside the target line on the downswing. This can lead to slices and loss of power. To correct this, focus on initiating the downswing with your lower body, allowing your hips and shoulders to lead. This will help you maintain a more controlled and efficient swing path. As always, using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach can help you identify and correct swing path issues. Lack of Follow-Through Completing Your Swing A lack of follow-through can affect the power and accuracy of your shots. Completing your swing allows for a full release of energy and ensures proper contact with the ball. To improve your follow-through, focus on maintaining a smooth and controlled motion throughout your swing. A common mistake is attempting to stop the swing abruptly after impact. This can lead to loss of power and control. Allow your swing to continue naturally, with your club finishing high and your body facing the target. Practicing your follow-through can help you develop a more powerful and accurate swing. Making small adjustments to your follow-through can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance. If youre struggling with your follow-through, consider using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9227529/,Golf Swing Biomechanics: A Systematic Review and Methodological Recommendations for Kinematics,"Estimating joint kinematics involves computing the relative motion between the segments. This permits a description of the movement regardless of the measurement coordinate system. This approach simplifies the description of motion as angles, which are given according to anatomical degrees of freedom. For instance, one would prefer to describe elbow flexion or pronosupination rather than the absolute positions of the arm and forearm within the laboratory measurement coordinate system. To simplify the analysis, the ISB has provided recommendations for defining anatomical frames for segments and joints [ 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 ].

The movements can be described using two different methods. The first relies on the direct use of experimental marker trajectories to define the segment reference frame in space and estimate the angles between the segment reference frames. The second method uses a multibody kinematic optimization technique [ 106 ]. The first is easier to implement but is more influenced by marker occlusion and soft tissue artifacts. The second permits the consideration of joint constraints to describe more physiological movements [ 107 ]. Recently, Mahadas et al. [ 108 ] highlighted the usefulness of OpenSim [ 109 , 110 ], an open-source software based on this methodology, for golf swing analysis.

3.8.2. Commentary on the Results

This section is mainly focused on joint angular kinematics; tables with typical values for each joint are provided after the commentaries on the results.

Ankle No publication has provided information on ankle kinematics during golf swing with the movement analysis standard of the ISB [49,50,51,52].

Knees Twelve studies considered the knee joint, and only four reported joint angles [47,111,112,113]. Several studies have focused on knee dynamics without providing results on knee kinematics. Murakami et al. [112] performed a reference analysis by creating a three-dimensional (3D) model with a scanner and then performing bone tracking with X-ray images (with 3D model adjustment). This approach is theoretically more accurate, but they only considered six instants (address, early backswing, late backswing, top-of-the-backswing, impact, and end of the follow-through). These values are reported in Table 4. The authors measured a cohort of five recreational golfers, and they can be considered as reference values for studies using optoelectronic motion capture systems, which measured similar values [47,111,113]. Somjarod et al. [113] studied professional and recreational golfers and measured a higher flexion for professionals of approximately 3° at the top-of-backswing (25° vs. 29°). Egret et al. [47] measured a lower flexion of approximately 20° in women compared to men (16 ± 6° vs. 35 ± 5°). Internal–external rotation of the knee has also been measured by Murakami et al. [112]. For the leading side, the global amplitude ranged from −7° to 10°, whereas it varied from −16° to 10° for the trail side. Abduction–adduction kinematics of the knee were investigated by Kim et al. [114,115], who aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a lateral heel wedge to reduce knee pain or anterior cruciate ligament rupture. They measured angles between 0.42 ± 0.73° and 5.95 ± 2.91° without the wedge club and between 0.30 ± 0.86° and 5.99 ± 3.17° with a wedge. They concluded that the wedge may reduce varus moment, but they did not show any results in terms of joint dynamics. However, these values were very similar, highlighting a trend. Although Murakami et al. [112] used two-dimensional (2D) scanner images, they estimated an accuracy of 0.3° for the rotation. However, the article by Ishimaru et al. [116], presented as the reference for method accuracy, studied patellar movement. The validation of the rotation accuracy seemed to be only performed for elementary movements with a lower acquisition frequency (three versus ten images per second). The study focused on elderly patients who underwent knee arthroplasty, and validation was performed on pig cadavers. Thus, one may expect lower accuracy for this more complex movement. This could explain the differences between the scanner image method and the optoelectronic method. However, the study of Murakami et al. [112] was the only one able to measure the antero-posterior translation during movement: 4.6 ± 9.2 mm for the lead side and 4.1 ± 3.6 mm for the trail side. The knee kinematics of recreational golfers have been shown to differ from those of professional golfers. Kim et al. [117] highlighted that professional golfers flexed their trail knee less, and Choi et al. [32,111], measured a second peak for a golfer lead knee. In contrast, Somjarod et al. [113] did not find any significant differences in trail knee flexion between professional and recreational golfers. Somjarod et al. [113]. also measured internal–external rotation of the knee, but their values were different between professional (−20° at the top of backswing) and recreational (−26° at the top of backswing) golfers. However, even though they presented values for the knee, these values appeared closer to the hip values. The method used was not well-detailed in the article, making it difficult to analyze the data, especially because the link between hip and knee internal–external rotations remains unknown. Finally, Purevsuren et al. [118] investigated the link between anterior cruciate ligament injury risk and knee kinematics. They highlighted the increase in ACL loading with decreased knee flexion and increased tibial rotation [118].

Hips Eleven studies considered hip kinematics [32,47,112,117,119,120,121,122,123,124] and eight articles reported joint angles [47,117,119,120,121,122,124]. One publication [112] reported values based on femur movement without the pelvis, which is needed to create the hip joint frame. Only two studies [32,117] decomposed the hip angle into its three basic components, but only the study by Kim et al. [117] reported hip joint kinematic values. The values are listed in Table 4. Other studies have provided superior values for hip angles. It was shown that hip movements were highly asymmetric [121], and a higher internal–external range of motion was observed for the lead hip than for the trail hip. The lead hip used almost the entire physiological range of motion of the hip in external rotation, backswing, and internal rotation during the downswing. This was confirmed by Alderslade et al. [119], who measured the hip internal–external rotation during the swing that remained within the passive angular corridor. In addition, lead hip movement was found to be highly linked to torso movement and was positively correlated with clubhead speed at ball impact [120]. Mun et al. [124] showed that rotation was initiated by the lead hip, followed by the lumbar spine; for professional golfers, lumbar and lead hip rotations were equally distributed. A lack of mobility for the lead hip has been linked to higher use of the lumbar spine [117]. This could explain the efficiency of a hip-stretching program in limiting low-back pain occurrence when golfers lack hip mobility [125]. Finally, Egret et al. [47] highlighted the differences between women and men, with higher hip movement amplitudes for women. Finally, one publication [126] investigated the joint angle differences induced by slight modifications to the ball position at the address. With the ball position varying by 4.3 cm, the hip flexion was modified up to 1.5° relative to the reference position. However, the mean variation was within the standard deviation of the reference frame, and the authors only considered the flexion–extension of the hips.

Torso Torso kinematics during golf swings have often been studied. Some authors included more details than on the X-factor. There were three different approaches: injury prevention, performance improvement, and group difference investigation. To date, two studies have focused on the modern swing, which is characterized by the need for a higher axial rotation of the torso. They suggested that the modern swing was associated with a higher injury risk in the lumbar spine [62,127]. However, Lindsay et al. [75] did not measure any significant kinematic differences between asymptomatic players and players with low-back pain, using a driver. Kim et al. [117] found that a lack of hip internal–external rotation was compensated by a modification of the pelvis kinematics, in particular, the posterior tilt and flexion of the lumbar spine. It was also demonstrated that an increase in torso axial rotation was correlated with an increase in the clubhead speed at ball impact [128], which is the same effect as the X-factor. Okuda et al. and Zheng et al. [48,129] found that skilled golfers began their torso rotation earlier than less-skilled golfers. Chu et al. [38] suggested that flexion/extension and lateral bending of the torso are kinematic parameters involved in performance. Furthermore, Joyce et al. [130] estimated that torso kinematics contributed 34–67% of the performance variance. Two studies identified coupling between torso and pelvis rotations, suggesting that experienced golfers succeeded in modifying their neuronal networks to synchronize their movements. For professional players, Beak et al. [131] found a correlation between torso and pelvis speed peaks. Sex-related differences were also assessed. On the one hand, Zheng et al. [132] showed that torso rotations were not significantly different between genders. On the other hand, Horan et al. [31] showed that men and women did not have the same optimal swing, and torso and pelvis movements were not the same between sexes. Lindsay et al. [75] showed that the torso kinematics differed according to the club used. The results differed when using a driver or 7-iron for flexion and lateral bending. Finally, Horan et al. [133] highlighted that performing a putting session before swinging improved torso mobility, specifically for women. This is quite contradictory to Henry et al. [63], who found no effect on the X-factor value of the warm-up before swinging. One publication [126] investigated the differences induced by slight modifications of the ball position at the address, although they did not directly correlate their findings with performance. The torso side bending and torso flexion were measured in the global frame. Only torso flexion was modified by with a minimal modification of about 1°. One publication [134] measured the coupling between the pelvis and torso rotation angles and highlighted different patterns depending on golfer skills.

Neck Only three studies considered neck kinematics or head movements [32,46,58]. In particular, Horan et al. [46] presented a new kinematics sequence: head, pelvis, and torso, in terms of rotational speeds for their participants. They measured a speed of approximately 210 ± 56°/s. However, the interest in taking the head for the kinematic sequence remains unclear.

Shoulder The shoulder joints have often been studied. However, the marker sets used were often minimal. The more common marker set (torso: manubrium, xyphoïd, acromions, 7th cervical vertebra, and 10th or 8th thoracic vertebra; arm: lateral and/or medial epicondyles of the humerus) was used to study the glenohumeral joint, with the assumption that the scapular girdles (clavicles and scapulae) were motionless in the torso. Ferdinands et al. [58] measured the global shoulder speed of approximately 6 rad/s. Teu et al. [135]. measured the contribution of each degree of freedom to the clubhead and estimated the internal/external rotation of the arm to contribute 14%, adduction/abduction 12%, and retroversion/anteversion 1%. Some studies have focused on sex differences and have shown kinematic differences between them. Zheng et al. [132] measured a significant difference in shoulder orientation, defined as the angle of the acromia line relative to the room frame. Egret et al. [47] measured a significant difference between men (82°*) and women (110°*). Variation induced by skill differences was also investigated. On the one hand, Choi et al. [32] measured no significant difference regarding shoulder kinematic smoothness (based on the jerk computation, the time derivative of acceleration). On the other hand, Healy et al. [136] measured a higher value of right shoulder flexion at the top of the backswing for experienced golfers, with a higher clubhead speed at impact with 5-iron. Egret et al. [30] also showed that experienced players appear to have a larger shoulder angle than less experienced players. Mitchell et al. [137] measured the variation in joint mobility in groups of golfers of various ages. They measured the decrease in shoulder mobility with age. Adduction in the horizontal plane was an exception, with an increase during the backswing. Finally, differences induced by clubs were investigated by Egret et al. [138], who found shoulder kinematic differences between drivers and 5-iron clubs and between drivers and pitching wedges, but not between 5-iron and pitching wedges. One study [126] investigated the differences induced by slight modifications in the ball position at the address. However, the induced modifications were very small for shoulder kinematics (less than 1° between configurations) and not statistically significant. Finally, one publication [25] addressed the issue of the negative effect of using a rough model for golf swing kinematic processing. They showed that even if the glenohumeral joint was the only one considered for golf swing analysis, the scapulothoracic and thoracoclavicular joints are used during the golf swing. Consequently, an inaccurate model of the shoulder joint may lead to inaccuracies in neighboring segments. Furthermore, they also published the values of inverse kinematics during the golf swing.

Elbow Even though elbows are often studied, their role in performance remains unknown. Only Zheng et al. [48,132], and Egret et al. [47] highlighted a kinematic difference; the more skilled the players are, the more able they are to extend their elbow during the swing. Additionally, according to Egret et al. [47], professional women seemed to have a faster elbow extension than professional men. They also measured [47] a higher amplitude for women than men, with a smaller angle at the top of the backswing and a higher angle at impact, which was in agreement with Zheng et al. [132]. From an injury point of view, McHardy et al. [3] showed that recreational golfers and women were more likely to have an elbow injury than professional golfers and men, respectively.","['Maxime Bourgain', 'Arts Et Metiers Institute Of Technology', 'Université Sorbonne Paris Nord', 'Ibhgc Institut De Biomécanique Humaine Georges Charpak', 'Hesam Université', 'Bd De L Hôpital', 'Paris', 'France', 'Philippe.Rouch Epf.Fr', 'P.R.']",2022-06-09 00:00:00,pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,"Estimating joint kinematics involves computing the relative motion between the segments.

Murakami et al. 112 performed a reference analysis by creating a three-dimensional 3D model with a scanner and then performing bone tracking with X-ray images with 3D model adjustment. This approach is theoretically more accurate, but they only considered six instants address, early backswing, late backswing, top-of-the-backswing, impact, and end of the follow-through. These values are reported in Table 4. The authors measured a cohort of five recreational golfers, and they can be considered as reference values for studies using optoelectronic motion capture systems, which measured similar values 47,111,113. Somjarod et al. 113 studied professional and recreational golfers and measured a higher flexion for professionals of approximately 3 at the top-of-backswing 25 vs. 29. Egret et al. 47 measured a lower flexion of approximately 20 in women compared to men 16  6 vs. 35  5. Internalexternal rotation of the knee has also been measured by Murakami et al. 112. For the leading side, the global amplitude ranged from 7 to 10, whereas it varied from 16 to 10 for the trail side. Abductionadduction kinematics of the knee were investigated by Kim et al. 114,115, who aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a lateral heel wedge to reduce knee pain or anterior cruciate ligament rupture. They measured angles between 0.42  0.73 and 5.95  2.91 without the wedge club and between 0.30  0.86 and 5.99  3.17 with a wedge. They concluded that the wedge may reduce varus moment, but they did not show any results in terms of joint dynamics. However, these values were very similar, highlighting a trend. Although Murakami et al. 112 used two-dimensional 2D scanner images, they estimated an accuracy of 0.3 for the rotation. However, the article by Ishimaru et al. 116, presented as the reference for method accuracy, studied patellar movement. The validation of the rotation accuracy seemed to be only performed for elementary movements with a lower acquisition frequency three versus ten images per second. The study focused on elderly patients who underwent knee arthroplasty, and validation was performed on pig cadavers. Thus, one may expect lower accuracy for this more complex movement. This could explain the differences between the scanner image method and the optoelectronic method. However, the study of Murakami et al. 112 was the only one able to measure the antero-posterior translation during movement 4.6  9.2 mm for the lead side and 4.1  3.6 mm for the trail side. The knee kinematics of recreational golfers have been shown to differ from those of professional golfers. Kim et al. 117 highlighted that professional golfers flexed their trail knee less, and Choi et al. 32,111, measured a second peak for a golfer lead knee. In contrast, Somjarod et al. 113 did not find any significant differences in trail knee flexion between professional and recreational golfers. Somjarod et al. 113. also measured internalexternal rotation of the knee, but their values were different between professional 20 at the top of backswing and recreational 26 at the top of backswing golfers. However, even though they presented values for the knee, these values appeared closer to the hip values. The method used was not well-detailed in the article, making it difficult to analyze the data, especially because the link between hip and knee internalexternal rotations remains unknown. Finally, Purevsuren et al. 118 investigated the link between anterior cruciate ligament injury risk and knee kinematics. They highlighted the increase in ACL loading with decreased knee flexion and increased tibial rotation 118. Hips Eleven studies considered hip kinematics 32,47,112,117,119,120,121,122,123,124 and eight articles reported joint angles 47,117,119,120,121,122,124. One publication 112 reported values based on femur movement without the pelvis, which is needed to create the hip joint frame. Only two studies 32,117 decomposed the hip angle into its three basic components, but only the study by Kim et al. 117 reported hip joint kinematic values. The values are listed in Table 4. Other studies have provided superior values for hip angles. It was shown that hip movements were highly asymmetric 121, and a higher internalexternal range of motion was observed for the lead hip than for the trail hip. The lead hip used almost the entire physiological range of motion of the hip in external rotation, backswing, and internal rotation during the downswing. This was confirmed by Alderslade et al. 119, who measured the hip internalexternal rotation during the swing that remained within the passive angular corridor. In addition, lead hip movement was found to be highly linked to torso movement and was positively correlated with clubhead speed at ball impact 120. Mun et al. 124 showed that rotation was initiated by the lead hip, followed by the lumbar spine for professional golfers, lumbar and lead hip rotations were equally distributed. A lack of mobility for the lead hip has been linked to higher use of the lumbar spine 117. This could explain the efficiency of a hip-stretching program in limiting low-back pain occurrence when golfers lack hip mobility 125. Finally, Egret et al. 47 highlighted the differences between women and men, with higher hip movement amplitudes for women. Finally, one publication 126 investigated the joint angle differences induced by slight modifications to the ball position at the address. With the ball position varying by 4.3 cm, the hip flexion was modified up to 1.5 relative to the reference position. However, the mean variation was within the standard deviation of the reference frame, and the authors only considered the flexionextension of the hips. Torso Torso kinematics during golf swings have often been studied. Some authors included more details than on the X-factor. There were three different approaches injury prevention, performance improvement, and group difference investigation. To date, two studies have focused on the modern swing, which is characterized by the need for a higher axial rotation of the torso. They suggested that the modern swing was associated with a higher injury risk in the lumbar spine 62,127. However, Lindsay et al. 75 did not measure any significant kinematic differences between asymptomatic players and players with low-back pain, using a driver. Kim et al. 117 found that a lack of hip internalexternal rotation was compensated by a modification of the pelvis kinematics, in particular, the posterior tilt and flexion of the lumbar spine. It was also demonstrated that an increase in torso axial rotation was correlated with an increase in the clubhead speed at ball impact 128, which is the same effect as the X-factor. Okuda et al. and Zheng et al. 48,129 found that skilled golfers began their torso rotation earlier than less-skilled golfers. Chu et al. 38 suggested that flexionextension and lateral bending of the torso are kinematic parameters involved in performance. Furthermore, Joyce et al. 130 estimated that torso kinematics contributed 3467 of the performance variance. Two studies identified coupling between torso and pelvis rotations, suggesting that experienced golfers succeeded in modifying their neuronal networks to synchronize their movements. For professional players, Beak et al. 131 found a correlation between torso and pelvis speed peaks. Sex-related differences were also assessed. On the one hand, Zheng et al. 132 showed that torso rotations were not significantly different between genders. On the other hand, Horan et al. 31 showed that men and women did not have the same optimal swing, and torso and pelvis movements were not the same between sexes. Lindsay et al. 75 showed that the torso kinematics differed according to the club used. The results differed when using a driver or 7-iron for flexion and lateral bending. Finally, Horan et al. 133 highlighted that performing a putting session before swinging improved torso mobility, specifically for women. This is quite contradictory to Henry et al. 63, who found no effect on the X-factor value of the warm-up before swinging. One publication 126 investigated the differences induced by slight modifications of the ball position at the address, although they did not directly correlate their findings with performance. The torso side bending and torso flexion were measured in the global frame. Only torso flexion was modified by with a minimal modification of about 1. One publication 134 measured the coupling between the pelvis and torso rotation angles and highlighted different patterns depending on golfer skills. Neck Only three studies considered neck kinematics or head movements 32,46,58. In particular, Horan et al. 46 presented a new kinematics sequence head, pelvis, and torso, in terms of rotational speeds for their participants. They measured a speed of approximately 210  56s. However, the interest in taking the head for the kinematic sequence remains unclear. Shoulder The shoulder joints have often been studied. However, the marker sets used were often minimal. The more common marker set torso manubrium, xyphoïd, acromions, 7th cervical vertebra, and 10th or 8th thoracic vertebra arm lateral andor medial epicondyles of the humerus was used to study the glenohumeral joint, with the assumption that the scapular girdles clavicles and scapulae were motionless in the torso. Ferdinands et al. 58 measured the global shoulder speed of approximately 6 rads. Teu et al. 135. measured the contribution of each degree of freedom to the clubhead and estimated the internalexternal rotation of the arm to contribute 14, adductionabduction 12, and retroversionanteversion 1. Some studies have focused on sex differences and have shown kinematic differences between them. Zheng et al. 132 measured a significant difference in shoulder orientation, defined as the angle of the acromia line relative to the room frame. Egret et al. 47 measured a significant difference between men 82 and women 110. Variation induced by skill differences was also investigated. On the one hand, Choi et al. 32 measured no significant difference regarding shoulder kinematic smoothness based on the jerk computation, the time derivative of acceleration. On the other hand, Healy et al. 136 measured a higher value of right shoulder flexion at the top of the backswing for experienced golfers, with a higher clubhead speed at impact with 5-iron. Egret et al. 30 also showed that experienced players appear to have a larger shoulder angle than less experienced players. Mitchell et al. 137 measured the variation in joint mobility in groups of golfers of various ages. They measured the decrease in shoulder mobility with age. Adduction in the horizontal plane was an exception, with an increase during the backswing. Finally, differences induced by clubs were investigated by Egret et al. 138, who found shoulder kinematic differences between drivers and 5-iron clubs and between drivers and pitching wedges, but not between 5-iron and pitching wedges. One study 126 investigated the differences induced by slight modifications in the ball position at the address. However, the induced modifications were very small for shoulder kinematics less than 1 between configurations and not statistically significant. Finally, one publication 25 addressed the issue of the negative effect of using a rough model for golf swing kinematic processing. They showed that even if the glenohumeral joint was the only one considered for golf swing analysis, the scapulothoracic and thoracoclavicular joints are used during the golf swing. Consequently, an inaccurate model of the shoulder joint may lead to inaccuracies in neighboring segments. Furthermore, they also published the values of inverse kinematics during the golf swing. Elbow Even though elbows are often studied, their role in performance remains unknown. Only Zheng et al. 48,132, and Egret et al. 47 highlighted a kinematic difference the more skilled the players are, the more able they are to extend their elbow during the swing. Additionally, according to Egret et al. 47, professional women seemed to have a faster elbow extension than professional men. They also measured 47 a higher amplitude for women than men, with a smaller angle at the top of the backswing and a higher angle at impact, which was in agreement with Zheng et al. 132. From an injury point of view, McHardy et al. 3 showed that recreational golfers and women were more likely to have an elbow injury than professional golfers and men, respectively.","['Estimating joint kinematics involves computing the relative motion between the segments. This permits a description of the movement regardless of the measurement coordinate system. This approach simplifies the description of motion as angles, which are given according to anatomical degrees of freedom. For instance, one would prefer to describe elbow flexion or pronosupination rather than the absolute positions of the arm and forearm within the laboratory measurement coordinate system. To simplify the analysis, the ISB has provided recommendations for defining anatomical frames for segments and joints 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 . The movements can be described using two different methods. The first relies on the direct use of experimental marker trajectories to define the segment reference frame in space and estimate the angles between the segment reference frames. The second method uses a multibody kinematic optimization technique 106 . The first is easier to implement but is more influenced by marker occlusion and soft tissue artifacts. The second permits the consideration of joint constraints to describe more physiological movements 107 . Recently, Mahadas et al. 108 highlighted the usefulness of OpenSim 109 , 110 , an open-source software based on this methodology, for golf swing analysis. 3.8.2. Commentary on the Results This section is mainly focused on joint angular kinematics tables with typical values for each joint are provided after the commentaries on the results.

This article doesn’t just skim the surface of the golf swing it dives deep, incorporating not only my personal journey to a better swing but also insights from golf pros and statistical data that illustrate common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Learn to Improve Your Golf Swing The Grip: Correct hand placement is crucial.

Correct hand placement is crucial. The Stance: Position your feet properly for balance.

Position your feet properly for balance. The Backswing, Downswing, Follow-Through: Essential steps for a powerful swing.

1. The Grip

The grip is your only connection to the golf club, and yet, it’s often the most overlooked aspect of a golfer’s game. I remember the first time a pro adjusted my grip; it felt completely foreign, yet it corrected years of self-taught errors. The grip dictates the club’s face angle at impact, influencing the ball’s flight path significantly.

For a proper grip, place the club in your non-dominant hand so that it sits diagonally across your fingers, from the base of the index finger to just below the pinkie’s pad. Your dominant hand then comes in to complement this hold, either linking (for most players) or overlapping (for those seeking a softer grip) the index finger of the non-dominant hand with the pinkie of the dominant hand.

Insider Tip: Spend at least five minutes during each practice session checking and correcting your grip, as suggested by a PGA tour coach. Small adjustments can lead to big improvements.

2. The Stance

Your stance is the foundation of your swing. A shaky foundation equals a shaky swing. The ideal stance is both comfortable and balanced, allowing you to swing the club with power and precision. Feet should be shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your weight evenly distributed between the balls of your feet and your heels.

I once had the habit of leaning too far forward, which I learned, limits the backswing and affects the swing path. Correcting this took conscious effort and a lot of mirror work, but it paid off in more consistent ball striking.

Insider Tip: Practice your stance in front of a mirror to ensure your back is straight and you’re not leaning too far forward or backward.

3. The Backswing

The backswing sets the stage for the downswing; it’s where power is built. A common mistake is to rush this part of the swing, which can throw off your timing and balance. A proper backswing feels smooth and controlled. The club should be taken back in a straight line, with the shoulders turning while the hips stay relatively quiet.

One game-changing tip I received was to think of the backswing as a coiling motion, maximizing potential energy. This mental image helped me improve the smoothness and power of my swing.

Insider Tip: Record your backswing with a smartphone. Watching yourself can reveal inconsistencies in your motion that you can’t feel.

Real-Life Example: Overcoming a Slice with Proper Backswing

John’s Struggle with a Slice

Growing up, John always struggled with slicing the ball when he played golf. No matter how hard he tried, the ball always seemed to veer off course. Frustrated, he sought advice from a golf instructor who pointed out that his backswing was the root of the issue.

Applying Proper Backswing Techniques

John diligently worked on improving his backswing, focusing on keeping his hands in the correct position and maintaining a smooth motion. With practice, he started to notice a significant difference in the trajectory of his shots. The ball flew straighter and farther, giving John the confidence he needed to enjoy the game even more.

The Impact of a Correct Backswing

By mastering the backswing technique, John was able to overcome his slice and improve his overall golf game. He learned firsthand the importance of proper backswing mechanics and how it can make a world of difference in the outcome of each shot.

4. The Downswing

The downswing is where the magic happens, where power is transferred to the ball. The key here is sequencing; the hips lead, then the torso, followed by the arms, and finally, the club. Getting this sequence right ensures maximum power and accuracy.

I learned the hard way that trying to start the downswing with my arms led to slices and inconsistent contact. Focusing on starting with my hips improved my ball striking significantly.

Insider Tip: Use a drill that emphasizes hip movement at the start of the downswing. This can help ingrain the proper sequence.

5. The Follow-Through

The follow-through is often seen as just a formality, but it’s actually a good indicator of the quality of your swing. A balanced, controlled follow-through suggests a swing that was equally balanced and controlled. Your body should be facing the target, with your weight shifted onto your front foot.

Working on my follow-through helped me understand the concept of swinging through the ball, not just to it, which made my shots more powerful and accurate.

Insider Tip: Focus on finishing with your chest facing the target and your back foot on its toes. This ensures a complete weight transfer.

6. The Finish

A graceful finish is the hallmark of a good golf swing. It indicates that you’ve maintained balance and control throughout the swing. In a proper finish, your weight is fully shifted onto the front foot, and the club is wrapped around your back, with the butt of the club pointing toward the target.

Early in my golf journey, I often found myself off-balance at the finish, a sign of issues earlier in my swing. Correcting this not only improved my balance but also the consistency and power of my shots.

Insider Tip: Practice swinging to a balanced finish, even without hitting a ball. This can improve muscle memory and balance.

7. Practice, Practice, Practice

Improvement in golf, as in anything, requires practice. But not just any practice focused, deliberate practice. Each session should have a goal, whether it’s working on your grip, stance, or swing sequence. Quality over quantity is the mantra.

I’ve found incorporating specific drills into my practice routine to be incredibly beneficial. For example, using a doorframe to check my swing path or placing a tee on the ground to practice my follow-through has led to noticeable improvements in my game.

Insider Tip: Divide your practice time between swing mechanics and actual play. Spending time on the course puts your practice into context.

This article doesnt just skim the surface of the golf swing it dives deep, incorporating not only my personal journey to a better swing but also insights from golf pros and statistical data that illustrate common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Learn to Improve Your Golf Swing The Grip Correct hand placement is crucial. Correct hand placement is crucial. The Stance Position your feet properly for balance. Position your feet properly for balance. The Backswing, Downswing, Follow-Through Essential steps for a powerful swing. 1. The Grip The grip is your only connection to the golf club, and yet, its often the most overlooked aspect of a golfers game. I remember the first time a pro adjusted my grip it felt completely foreign, yet it corrected years of self-taught errors. The grip dictates the clubs face angle at impact, influencing the balls flight path significantly. For a proper grip, place the club in your non-dominant hand so that it sits diagonally across your fingers, from the base of the index finger to just below the pinkies pad. Your dominant hand then comes in to complement this hold, either linking for most players or overlapping for those seeking a softer grip the index finger of the non-dominant hand with the pinkie of the dominant hand. Insider Tip Spend at least five minutes during each practice session checking and correcting your grip, as suggested by a PGA tour coach. Small adjustments can lead to big improvements. 2. The Stance Your stance is the foundation of your swing. A shaky foundation equals a shaky swing. The ideal stance is both comfortable and balanced, allowing you to swing the club with power and precision. Feet should be shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your weight evenly distributed between the balls of your feet and your heels. I once had the habit of leaning too far forward, which I learned, limits the backswing and affects the swing path. Correcting this took conscious effort and a lot of mirror work, but it paid off in more consistent ball striking. Insider Tip Practice your stance in front of a mirror to ensure your back is straight and youre not leaning too far forward or backward. 3. The Backswing The backswing sets the stage for the downswing its where power is built. A common mistake is to rush this part of the swing, which can throw off your timing and balance. A proper backswing feels smooth and controlled. The club should be taken back in a straight line, with the shoulders turning while the hips stay relatively quiet. One game-changing tip I received was to think of the backswing as a coiling motion, maximizing potential energy. This mental image helped me improve the smoothness and power of my swing. Insider Tip Record your backswing with a smartphone. Watching yourself can reveal inconsistencies in your motion that you cant feel. Real-Life Example Overcoming a Slice with Proper Backswing Johns Struggle with a Slice Growing up, John always struggled with slicing the ball when he played golf. No matter how hard he tried, the ball always seemed to veer off course. Frustrated, he sought advice from a golf instructor who pointed out that his backswing was the root of the issue. Applying Proper Backswing Techniques John diligently worked on improving his backswing, focusing on keeping his hands in the correct position and maintaining a smooth motion. With practice, he started to notice a significant difference in the trajectory of his shots. The ball flew straighter and farther, giving John the confidence he needed to enjoy the game even more. The Impact of a Correct Backswing By mastering the backswing technique, John was able to overcome his slice and improve his overall golf game. He learned firsthand the importance of proper backswing mechanics and how it can make a world of difference in the outcome of each shot. 4. The Downswing The downswing is where the magic happens, where power is transferred to the ball. The key here is sequencing the hips lead, then the torso, followed by the arms, and finally, the club. Getting this sequence right ensures maximum power and accuracy. I learned the hard way that trying to start the downswing with my arms led to slices and inconsistent contact. Focusing on starting with my hips improved my ball striking significantly. Insider Tip Use a drill that emphasizes hip movement at the start of the downswing. This can help ingrain the proper sequence. 5. The Follow-Through The follow-through is often seen as just a formality, but its actually a good indicator of the quality of your swing. A balanced, controlled follow-through suggests a swing that was equally balanced and controlled. Your body should be facing the target, with your weight shifted onto your front foot. Working on my follow-through helped me understand the concept of swinging through the ball, not just to it, which made my shots more powerful and accurate. Insider Tip Focus on finishing with your chest facing the target and your back foot on its toes. This ensures a complete weight transfer. 6. The Finish A graceful finish is the hallmark of a good golf swing. It indicates that youve maintained balance and control throughout the swing.

The concepts presented by your coach or fitness trainer might be verbal or demonstrable, but how do you apply these changes in movement and position to your actual golf swing?

PGA Professional Brian Newman of Orange Whip Golf Fitness X, shares three very beneficial drills below that will have a huge impact on your golf swing — not through intense repetition on the range, but through a focus on your body.

Drill 1: Feet Together — L to L Swings (5-10 reps)

What to do:

With the feet together, make a three-quarter backswing and follow-through, continuously swinging back and forth without stopping. On the backswing, get the lead arm and the club’s shaft to create the letter “L” when the lead arm is parallel to the ground. On the forward swing, create an “L” with the trail arm and the club’s shaft when the trail arm is parallel to the ground. When creating the “L” position on both sides of the swing, attempt to get the butt of the club to point toward the ground on an extended line of the ball. Hit the ground at the same spot during the forward swing as you do when returning to the backswing. Be sure to shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot (downswing) and vice versa during the backswing.

Drill benefits:

Creates a consistent low point of the swing and keeps the player balanced

Syncs the arms and body and trains the proper levers and wrist hinge

Enhances rhythm, tempo and balance

Can be done with or without a golf ball

Great progression to teach rotation and weight shift

Improves core, hip and leg strength, as well as stability, flexibility and mobility

Suitable for all skill levels

Drill 2: Elbow Block Drill (5-10 reps)

What to do:

Block the trail elbow by reaching the lead arm across the body and position the back of the lead hand behind the elbow. On the backswing, maintain the lead hand’s “blocked” position behind your trail elbow. Rotate the trail arm externally through the shoulder to point the elbow toward the ground at the top of your swing. Begin the downswing and, while still blocking the trail elbow, allow the trail elbow to lead the downswing, pointing toward the ground as the body begins to rotate. Swing to a full finish, maintaining the elbow block. Repeat this for the lead arm, blocking the elbow with the back of the trail hand.

Drill benefits:

Helps create and maintain space between the arms and body

Fixes arm, hand and swing path and trains a powerful release

Forces proper trail arm and lead arm delivery of the club

Ensures the body is practicing efficient posture, rotation and weight shift

Creates immediate feedback when hitting balls

Increases leg, arm and hand speed

Can be performed with or without a ball

Improves mobility of the trail and lead arm

Trains arms independently

Drill 3: Rev-Up Swings (3-5 reps)

What to do:

Assume your set-up. Extend the arms and club towards the target, keeping the trail shoulder pointing towards the ground, the hips and chest open to the target, with air under the trail heel. Initiate a backswing with the lower body and allow the arms and club to follow, giving the lower body a head start. As the club is swinging back during the backswing, allow for the hips to initiate the downswing’s weight shift and turn, creating separation between the lower and upper body segments with body and club shaft lag. Note: Do not pause at the top of the swing. Allow the hips to fire while the upper body and club are approaching the top, creating the “Rev-Up” feel.

Drill benefits:

Increases swing speed and power instantly

Improves weight during both the backswing and forward swing

Trains a proper and powerful transition

Can be done with or without the ball

Creates natural feel of the takeaway and creates momentum into the downswing

Assists with hand and arm positioning

Teaches upper body and lower body separation

Whether you’re aiming to be the next big thing at the National Golf Club of Louisiana or simply looking to shave a few strokes off your game, integrating these 10 drills into your practice routine can transform your play. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill exercises; they’re tailored to refine your skills, focusing on precision, consistency, and the all-important mental aspect of golf. Alongside, I’ll share insights into shot shapes and trajectories that are game-changers. Let’s get started.

Improve Your Golf Game with These Drills Learn 10 effective golf drills for improving your game at the National Golf Club of Louisiana.

The drills include 3-6-9 Putting, Ladder, Tee, Clock, Box, Gate, Circle, Coin, Line, and Two-Tee drills.

Find out answers to FAQs about the best golf drills, improving your swing at home, beginner-friendly drills, and effective golf practice techniques.

1. The 3-6-9 Putting Drill

Putting is an art, and the 3-6-9 Drill is your canvas. Set up three markers at 3, 6, and 9 feet from the hole. Challenge yourself to make a certain number of putts in a row from each distance. This drill isnt just about honing your accuracy; its about building pressure-handling skills. Remember, confidence on the green translates to strokes saved.

2. The Ladder Drill

Distance control with your irons is non-negotiable. The Ladder Drill involves hitting balls to various distances with the same club, focusing on controlling your swing length and speed. It’s a phenomenal way to understand your clubs better and master the art of precision.

3. The Tee Drill

A simple yet effective drill for improving your swing path and eliminating slices or hooks. Place a tee on either side of your golf ball, narrowly spaced. The objective is to hit the ball without disturbing the tees, promoting a straighter, more controlled shot.

4. The Clock Drill

Putting again, because let’s face it, it’s where games are won or lost. The Clock Drill involves placing balls around the hole at equal distances, resembling the numbers on a clock. This not only improves your putting from various angles but enhances your ability to read greens.

5. The Box Drill

Intended to perfect your chipping, the Box Drill involves chipping balls into a designated box from various distances. Its crucial for touch and feel around the greens, turning potential bogeys into pars or even birdies.

6. The Gate Drill

For fine-tuning your putting stroke, the Gate Drill involves creating a “gate” with two objects just wider than your putter head. Stroke through the gate to ensure a straight-back, straight-through movement. Consistency is key.

Personal Experience: The Ladder Drill

I used to struggle with my short game, especially with hitting the ball the right distance. After trying various drills, I came across the ladder drill, which completely transformed my approach.

Rachel’s Story

Women playing at the National Golf Club of Louisiana

During practice, I set up 6 balls at increasing distances, starting from 10 feet and ending at 60 feet from the hole. The goal was to sink all 6 putts in a row. This drill not only improved my distance control but also boosted my confidence on the greens. I found that it translated into better performance during my actual rounds, and I was able to lower my overall score as a result. The ladder drill has become a staple in my practice routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their putting game.

7. The Circle Drill

Another putting drill, the Circle Drill emphasizes short, challenging putts. Place balls in a circle around the hole at a set distance. Rotate around, sinking each putt. It’s perfect for building confidence under pressure.

8. The Coin Drill

A hidden gem for improving your ball-striking. Place a coin slightly behind the ball. The goal is to strike the ball first, then the coin, promoting a descending blow which is crucial for solid, consistent contact.

9. The Line Drill

Alignment is often the culprit for errant shots. Lay a club or alignment stick on the ground, pointing towards your target. Practice your swings ensuring your feet, hips, and shoulders are parallel to the line. Its simple but remarkably effective.

10. The Two-Tee Drill

Designed to refine your driver swing, the Two-Tee Drill involves placing two tees on the ground, forming a gate just wider than your drivers head. The objective is to swing through the gate without hitting the tees, promoting a straighter path and reducing the risk of slices.

https://www.golfmonthly.com/tips/10-best-golf-drills-ever-195681,10 Best Golf Drills Ever – Recommended By A Top PGA Pro,"Every player should implement the best golf drills into their practice sessions, as they have the potential to supercharge your progress on the course.

Whether you are looking to achieve a centred strike with your driver, find the right ball position with hybrids or learn how to compress the golf ball with a better impact position, this article has something for you.

While there isn't necessarily a one size fits all approach to fixing the most common swing faults, I am going to use my extensive knowledge and years of experience as a PGA professional to help you play better golf...

1. Best Golf Drills: Ball-Striking

Nothing beats striking the ball well, out of the middle of the clubface, but sometimes it can be hard to know how close we are to 'middling' it. To get a better understanding, try spraying dry shampoo on the face of the club.

After you have hit the ball, the instant feedback provided by the mark left on the face will tell you everything you need to know. This is a great way to identify your focus moving forwards, whether that be learning how to stop toe strikes or getting a better understanding of golf shank causes.

2. Slice Fix

Golfers who struggle with a slice could ease their woes with the help of a simple training aid... a swimming noodle. This relatively cheap tool can help you to understand the swing path you are trying to achieve, and provide visual feedback instantly.

Place the noodle on the floor in a position that mirrors the semi-circular movement of the golf swing (see image below), and take some slow practice swings.

Feel how you move back in a circle. At the bottom, the club is moving down and coming through impact, before going on around in that circle to the finish.

Using this drill should improve your directional control, get your clubface more towards target and start to produce more solid strikes.

Setting up a swimming noodle as above will help you hone a better club path (Image credit: Tom Miles)

3. Rhythm

Often, golfers think that swinging the club too fast is the reason their rhythm is out of whack, when in fact it's more to do with the order in which they change direction.

Ideally, we want a smooth rotation of the body, almost setting the club at the top of the backswing and adopting a rhythmical change of direction.

When you are ready in your address position, make a good 90 degree should turn with your left shoulder pointing downwards to the ball.

Take the club to the top of the backswing and smoothly rotate your lower body to initiate the downswing.

The lead hip and leg rotate to initiate this, so get used to the feeling that creates as this will help to generate a great downswing sequence.

Set the club at the top then work on transitioning smoothly into the downswing (Image credit: Tom Miles)

4. Bunker Drill

This essential bunker drill will help you to understand how to get the ball out of the trap first time and how the club interacts with the sand.

Having a visual reference will help here, so draw a small rectangle in the sand around your golf ball. The idea is to remove all of the sand from inside your rectangle, with a clear entry point behind that ball.

Set-up with the ball a fraction ahead of centre, with slightly more weight on your front foot. Open the clubface, as this will allow you to start using the sole of the club more efficiently and will prevent the leading edge digging into the sand.

Take a swing and let your trail hand work down and underneath, throwing the sand nice and high towards the target.

Drawing a box around the ball and aim to remove the sand within is a great way to improve your bunker play (Image credit: Tom Miles)

5. Strike The Match

You won't get the desired result with your long-irons without the correct speed through impact. But it's not all about swinging as fast as you can.

Learning how to compress the golf ball is far more important. As the club comes into impact, imagine yourself striking a match, imagine that same sound.

A sharp sound through impact means you've generated good speed, and crucially, at the right moment. This will help you improve launch, control and distance you hit your irons.

Imagine you're trying to light a match when hitting your irons (Image credit: Tom Miles)

6. Tee Peg Drill

The is a difference between pitching and chipping, so before working on your short game, it pays to improve your understanding.

Designed to help your pitching, this drill is especially useful in getting rid of that nasty habit where the leading edge of the club digs down too much, one reason for those dreaded duff shots.

Instead, tee the ball up, take your normal set-up position and rehearse a few swings, visualising just clipping the ball up and away off the tee.

A shallower angle of attack will allow the sole of the club and the bounce angle to do the work. Breaking the tee is a no-no, as this means that the leading edge on your club is digging down.

This drill will help you shallow out your strike when chipping (Image credit: Tom Miles)

7. Hybrid Drill

Even though the best golf hybrids are designed to be easy to hit, there’s a tendency for club golfers to get too shallow. In fact, you need more of a downward impact, which is where this drill will help.

Place a coin two or three inches in front of the ball and play your shot as you would do normally. If you miss the coin, it’s because the sole of the club is travelling upwards too soon – the likely result is a thin contact.

You want to hit the coin, as this tells you that you have the correct downward angle of attack. This will lead to purer and more consistent strikes, which is going to give you added distance too.

Placing a coin in front of the ball and trying to remove it after impact will improve the quality of your strikes (Image credit: Tom Miles)

8. Putting Technique Drill

You could be the best player in the world at reading greens, but if you don’t start the ball on the right lines, the putts simply won’t drop.

This is why clubface alignment at impact is so crucial. In a bid to improve in this area, many people turn to their putting technique, but the answer is often much simpler.

The task here is clear: hit the ball along the metre rule into the hole.

This is one of my favourite putting drills that will help you to square the clubface at impact on a more consistent basis, while giving you visual feedback as to whether you’re pushing putts by opening the face, or pulling them by closing it.

In both cases, the ball will roll off the metre rule. If your speed is right, you’ll find the bottom of the cup.

Trying to hit a putt along a metre rule will enable you to control the putter face more (Image credit: Tom Miles)

9. Club Face Control

You can practise this at home to improve your awareness of how the clubface is affected by the way you hold the club. Attach a pencil to the centre of your clubface with Blu Tack, as shown.

At address, the pencil should cover the alignment stick. From here, you’ll get an understanding of where your clubface is during the backswing and whether you tend to open it (pencil up), close it (pencil down) or keep it fairly neutral (pencil straight).

A strong golf grip with lots of knuckles showing on the top hand will encourage more of a closed clubface when you take the club back; a weak golf grip will see the pencil pointing more towards the sky.

Work on presenting the club back to target without any twisting or manipulation.

This visual aid will give you instant feedback on your clubface alignment (Image credit: Tom Miles)

10. Topping Fix

Topping often comes as a result of trying to hit up on the ball. It’s a common fault in which you see the elbows separating and the wrists then acting to save the shot.

If you're guilty of this and want a drill on how to stop topping the golf ball, you've come to the right place. First, apply the resistance band as shown.

What I’m having to do is fight the resistance pulling my arms back towards my body. It helps you get used to the feeling of your arms extending as you go out and down towards the ball.

After a few swings, remove the band and you should find it’s far easier to get your arms extended.

Brush the ground with the sole and get that ‘whoosh’ sound. This will tell you that you’re extending your arms more and your chances of topping the ball will be greatly reduced.

Using a resistance band like this will help you stop topping the ball for good (Image credit: Tom Miles)","['Ged Walters', 'Top Coach', 'Social Links Navigation']",2020-04-17 12:53:01+00:00,www.golfmonthly.com,"Every player should implement the best golf drills into their practice sessions, as they have the potential to supercharge your progress on the course.

Designed to help your pitching, this drill is especially useful in getting rid of that nasty habit where the leading edge of the club digs down too much, one reason for those dreaded duff shots. Instead, tee the ball up, take your normal set-up position and rehearse a few swings, visualising just clipping the ball up and away off the tee. A shallower angle of attack will allow the sole of the club and the bounce angle to do the work. Breaking the tee is a no-no, as this means that the leading edge on your club is digging down. This drill will help you shallow out your strike when chipping Image credit Tom Miles 7. Hybrid Drill Even though the best golf hybrids are designed to be easy to hit, theres a tendency for club golfers to get too shallow. In fact, you need more of a downward impact, which is where this drill will help. Place a coin two or three inches in front of the ball and play your shot as you would do normally. If you miss the coin, its because the sole of the club is travelling upwards too soon  the likely result is a thin contact. You want to hit the coin, as this tells you that you have the correct downward angle of attack. This will lead to purer and more consistent strikes, which is going to give you added distance too. Placing a coin in front of the ball and trying to remove it after impact will improve the quality of your strikes Image credit Tom Miles 8. Putting Technique Drill You could be the best player in the world at reading greens, but if you dont start the ball on the right lines, the putts simply wont drop. This is why clubface alignment at impact is so crucial. In a bid to improve in this area, many people turn to their putting technique, but the answer is often much simpler. The task here is clear hit the ball along the metre rule into the hole. This is one of my favourite putting drills that will help you to square the clubface at impact on a more consistent basis, while giving you visual feedback as to whether youre pushing putts by opening the face, or pulling them by closing it. In both cases, the ball will roll off the metre rule. If your speed is right, youll find the bottom of the cup. Trying to hit a putt along a metre rule will enable you to control the putter face more Image credit Tom Miles 9. Club Face Control You can practise this at home to improve your awareness of how the clubface is affected by the way you hold the club. Attach a pencil to the centre of your clubface with Blu Tack, as shown. At address, the pencil should cover the alignment stick. From here, youll get an understanding of where your clubface is during the backswing and whether you tend to open it pencil up, close it pencil down or keep it fairly neutral pencil straight. A strong golf grip with lots of knuckles showing on the top hand will encourage more of a closed clubface when you take the club back a weak golf grip will see the pencil pointing more towards the sky. Work on presenting the club back to target without any twisting or manipulation. This visual aid will give you instant feedback on your clubface alignment Image credit Tom Miles 10. Topping Fix Topping often comes as a result of trying to hit up on the ball. Its a common fault in which you see the elbows separating and the wrists then acting to save the shot. If youre guilty of this and want a drill on how to stop topping the golf ball, youve come to the right place. First, apply the resistance band as shown. What Im having to do is fight the resistance pulling my arms back towards my body. It helps you get used to the feeling of your arms extending as you go out and down towards the ball. After a few swings, remove the band and you should find its far easier to get your arms extended. Brush the ground with the sole and get that whoosh sound. This will tell you that youre extending your arms more and your chances of topping the ball will be greatly reduced. Using a resistance band like this will help you stop topping the ball for good Image credit Tom Miles","['Every player should implement the best golf drills into their practice sessions, as they have the potential to supercharge your progress on the course. Whether you are looking to achieve a centred strike with your driver, find the right ball position with hybrids or learn how to compress the golf ball with a better impact position, this article has something for you. While there isnt necessarily a one size fits all approach to fixing the most common swing faults, I am going to use my extensive knowledge and years of experience as a PGA professional to help you play better golf... 1. Best Golf Drills Ball-Striking Nothing beats striking the ball well, out of the middle of the clubface, but sometimes it can be hard to know how close we are to middling it. To get a better understanding, try spraying dry shampoo on the face of the club. After you have hit the ball, the instant feedback provided by the mark left on the face will tell you everything you need to know. This is a great way to identify your focus moving forwards, whether that be learning how to stop toe strikes or getting a better understanding of golf shank causes. Spraying the clubface with dry shampoo will help golfers identify their tendencies and try to address them Image credit Tom Miles 2. Slice Fix Golfers who struggle with a slice could ease their woes with the help of a simple training aid... a swimming noodle. This relatively cheap tool can help you to understand the swing path you are trying to achieve, and provide visual feedback instantly. Place the noodle on the floor in a position that mirrors the semi-circular movement of the golf swing see image below, and take some slow practice swings.

At the bottom, the club is moving down and coming through impact, before going on around in that circle to the finish. Using this drill should improve your directional control, get your clubface more towards target and start to produce more solid strikes. Setting up a swimming noodle as above will help you hone a better club path Image credit Tom Miles 3. Rhythm Often, golfers think that swinging the club too fast is the reason their rhythm is out of whack, when in fact its more to do with the order in which they change direction. Ideally, we want a smooth rotation of the body, almost setting the club at the top of the backswing and adopting a rhythmical change of direction. When you are ready in your address position, make a good 90 degree should turn with your left shoulder pointing downwards to the ball. Take the club to the top of the backswing and smoothly rotate your lower body to initiate the downswing. The lead hip and leg rotate to initiate this, so get used to the feeling that creates as this will help to generate a great downswing sequence. Set the club at the top then work on transitioning smoothly into the downswing Image credit Tom Miles 4. Bunker Drill This essential bunker drill will help you to understand how to get the ball out of the trap first time and how the club interacts with the sand. Having a visual reference will help here, so draw a small rectangle in the sand around your golf ball. The idea is to remove all of the sand from inside your rectangle, with a clear entry point behind that ball. Set-up with the ball a fraction ahead of centre, with slightly more weight on your front foot. Open the clubface, as this will allow you to start using the sole of the club more efficiently and will prevent the leading edge digging into the sand. Take a swing and let your trail hand work down and underneath, throwing the sand nice and high towards the target. Drawing a box around the ball and aim to remove the sand within is a great way to improve your bunker play Image credit Tom Miles 5. Strike The Match You wont get the desired result with your long-irons without the correct speed through impact. But its not all about swinging as fast as you can. Learning how to compress the golf ball is far more important. As the club comes into impact, imagine yourself striking a match, imagine that same sound. A sharp sound through impact means youve generated good speed, and crucially, at the right moment. This will help you improve launch, control and distance you hit your irons.

Have you ever been more frustrated than when you thought you pured a golf shot and it ended up missing your target by 20 yards? In most cases, you realize that you were miss-aligned.

However, it is common for one to misinterpret that result as a swing error rather than faulty alignment.

If I had to come up with a perfect guess I would say 8 out of every 10 students that come to my lesson tee are frustrated telling me that they cannot aim themselves correctly to their target to save their life.

This is obviously a huge problem as we all know golf is a game of misses.

Its hard enough to hit shots in the sweet spot.

Ben Hogan said he only hit the sweet spot 4 times per round.

We definitely dont want to see our good swings wasted because we were aimed at something other than the target. I read once that if you are aimed 5 degrees off-line, you can miss a shot by close to 20 yards! Holy cow! It goes without saying that it is no good having a perfect set up, perfect grip and perfect swing if the whole thing is miss-aligned.

It sounds obvious but many players simply do not spend enough time getting themselves on target. - Nick Faldo.

Why Are the Pros So Concerned with Alignment? Early on, when I competed in professional events or attended them as a spectator, I was always taken by the number of players who had clubs laid on the ground at the practice tee. I would routinely see their swing coaches behind them helping them tinker with the smallest details in the set up, particularly alignment.

Tour players are obsessive compulsive about alignment and thats putting it lightly.

For they know how easily shots can be wasted with miss-alignment, but also how it can adversely affect their golf swing. I often say lack of practice on alignment is what keeps me in business.

When players slowly get off on their aim it affects their swing causing compensations.

In an era where the big buzzword seems to be connected, its interesting how few golfers actually are. I dont mean on Facebook, Linkedin or Twitter, I mean to their golf club.

Rarely does a student come to the lesson tee where I dont have to make some sort of adjustment to his or her grip.

It is, in my opinion, the most difficult thing to get a golfer to change and to get a golfer accustomed to. I usually will start the lesson by saying, Its unfortunate, but we are going to have to change your grip.

We are going to do it first and get it out-of-the-way because it is going to make everything else you do feel awkward and you arent going to like me for a while.

It is sort of the standard reply I developed after years of having to overcome the resistance. I figured I might as well just tell them that it is going to be difficult up front.

People are very resistant to change in general and seem to be very in love with what actually doesnt work.

There are Three Standard Grips.

Feel like you are holding a baby bird.

Grip it and rip it! Are you kidding me? Wow! Could it get any more confusing? These are just two of the quotes about gripping the golf club that you often hear by well-meaning pros or those that think they are pros.

Not to mention there are 3 standard styles of gripping the club for the full swing that are taught throughout the world.

The Vardon grip or overlapping, the interlock and the 10 finger or baseball grip.

No wonder it is a major source of frustration for both students and teachers.

Establishing good posture and maintaining it throughout the swing is the key to golfing success on so many levels.

Among other things, posture affects your consistency, balance, swing plane and club head speed.

Ive seen countless numbers of students with their swing center moving all over the place, their head bobbing up and down and struggling to simply not fall over during their swings! With all of that going on it is impossible to achieve our ultimate goal which is to return the shaft on the same angle or plane as it was at set up.

Your Posture is the Foundation of Your Swing.

Just like the foundation for your house, your posture needs to be a stable base for your swing.

There is a lot going on in your swing.

You are turning or pivoting, shifting your weight and swinging a long shaft with a steel head at high speed.

Sound swings start with posture that enables all of this to happen while maintaining a constant swing center, balance and the ability to remain athletic and flexible.

When it comes to constant swing center and balance you need to establish a posture that will keep your center of gravity fairly low and prevent your pelvis from moving all over in space.

Often I hear players tell me they look up during their swing causing them to top the ball.

https://www.mygolfinstructor.com/instruction/diagnosing-problems/how-the-hips-work/,How The Hips Work,"The Mystery of the Hips.

Hips Opening Through Impact.

The middle section of the body provides for a lot of discussion in golf.

Although there are hoards of questions that students pose on the lesson tee, the topic of hips is one that always results in a fairly lengthy conversation.

There seems to be a lot of confusion between what a person feels and what they are actually doing with their hips.

If I posed the question Should your hips turn or slide in the golf swing? to 10 students in a day, Im likely to get 10 different answers.

This area of our body holds our organs, is the center of our chior life force from ancient arts and it is the key to power in our golf swing.

Keep Your Butt Back.

Our hips can provide either stability or instability and they are designed to rotate.

When we set the hips in a good position at address, they are more likely to stay there and provide a stable base throughout the swing.

This means we will be able to stay in balance while rotating the body with force and not torque our lower backs and end up with an injury.

When we start with the hips in a poor position or move them out of position as we swing, the entire golf swing becomes unbalanced, unstable, less powerful and we become more prone for injury.

Hips Opening Through Impact.

The middle section of the body provides for a lot of discussion in golf.

Although there are hoards of questions that students pose on the lesson tee, the topic of hips is one that always results in a fairly lengthy conversation.

There seems to be a lot of confusion between what a person feels and what they are actually doing with their hips.

If I posed the question Should your hips turn or slide in the golf swing? to 10 students in a day, Im likely to get 10 different answers.

This area of our body holds our organs, is the center of our chior life force from ancient arts and it is the key to power in our golf swing.

Keep Your Butt Back.

Our hips can provide either stability or instability and they are designed to rotate.

When we set the hips in a good position at address, they are more likely to stay there and provide a stable base throughout the swing.

This means we will be able to stay in balance while rotating the body with force and not torque our lower backs and end up with an injury.

When we start with the hips in a poor position or move them out of position as we swing, the entire golf swing becomes unbalanced, unstable, less powerful and we become more prone for injury.

What is a flip? Quite a few times a student has posed the question - Whats the hardest thing to fix in the golf swing? My answer and that of most golf professionals is one of two things a an early release or b a flip.

What is a flip in the golf swing? The term flip refers to an incorrect cupping of the wrists through the impact zone.

If you take the back of your front hand and pull it up towards the back of your forearm you will see the backwards bend in your wrist that is referred to as cupping.

Ideally, we want the back of our front hand to stay flat or in line with our forearm and heres why.

When you release your wrists early and cup through impact a host of errors follow.

The most common are The clubhead hits the ground before the ball as a result of uncocking your wrists too early as you come into the ball.

This causes a fat shot.

The clubhead misses the ground because you uncock your wrists as you come into the ball, but it then comes up too quickly as you cup your wrists resulting in a skulled or thin shot.

As you cup your wrists you add unwanted loft resulting in a scoop and a much weaker shot with a noticeable loss of distance.

Basically you lose control and can hit a wide variety of ugly shots because as you flip the clubhead passes your hands.

When the clubhead is past your hands, you are no longer in control of it.",[],,www.mygolfinstructor.com,"Flat Front Wrist at Impact.

https://www.mygolfinstructor.com/instruction/diagnosing-problems/impact/,Impact: The Only Moment that Really Matters in Golf,"It is absolutely ASTONISHING to me that the majority of golfers are playing a game that requires movement of a ball and they have no comprehension of what causes the ball to move the way it does.

Whats criminal is the lack of proper instruction or instruction at all on impact, when it should be the FIRST thing taught.

Instructors spend time on things like posture, grip, pivot and weight shift in the first lesson and all the while, the student has no concept of what it is they are actually trying to accomplish.

This is my favorite subject in golf and I could probably bore you with hours of reading, but instead Im going to summarize what I feel you NEED and MUST know NOW to improve your game.

What Moves The Ball? What moves the ball? This was the question asked to me by Michael Hebron in 1992 when I was a very distraught collegiate player standing on his lesson tee in desperate search of answers. I was also in search of a decent golf instructor or rather one who wasnt afraid to say what he thought and assist in learning, rather than forcing upon the student a method. I quickly deemed Mike the mad scientist.

His research and knowledge was overwhelming and definitely became the basis on which I built my own teaching style.

What I liked best about him was that he looked right at me and told me I was no good.

For years I had been told I had a pretty swing and had spent too much money and time with instructors who didnt offer any concrete advice.

Impact is the moment of truth.

For centuries expert players have deemed impact the moment of truth.

This is because the ball does not lie.

Proper Balance Eliminates the Reverse Pivot.

There are 3 main reverse pivots in the golf swing.

To help understand what is meant by a reverse pivot, remember that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Your body wants to be in balance.

No one wants to fall over, so we are well equipped to subconsciously activate self balancing reactions when we sense our equilibrium is off.

This is what happens when you reverse pivot.

The term reverse here simply means you are doing things backwards or in reverse order.

When you reverse pivot in your golf swing your weight and body parts move in the opposite direction to which they are supposed to.

In other words, when your weight should move onto your back foot and then onto your front foot, with a reverse pivot it does the opposite.

Your weight will move towards your target onto your front foot and then it will fall away from the target onto your back foot.

When your weight is not moving correctly and with the force of your swing, you will lose a lot of power.

Having your weight reverse also leads to off plane swing conditions, loss of direction and inconsistent contact.

So not only will you hit the ball shorter, you will end up spraying it all over the place if your are not properly balanced with stacked body parts during the swing.

The 3 reverse pivots 1 Lower body reverse pivot on the takeaway.

Here, your hips and lower body move towards the target on the takeaway forcing your weight to lean onto your front foot.

As a result you will usually then rock onto your back side as you come into the ball. 2 Lower body reverse pivot on the down swing.

Here your hips and lower body move backwards and you fall back on your rear foot as you swing into the ball. 3 Hip slide  upper body reverse pivot on the back swing.

Your hips slide or sway away from the target and as a result, your upper body leans back towards the target.",[],,www.mygolfinstructor.com,"Understanding a Reverse Pivot.
