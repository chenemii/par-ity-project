Players are swinging faster than ever, leading to longer drives and improved scoring potential.

This has been especially prevalent on the PGA TOUR where average clubhead speed is up over 3.5 mph in the last decade, from 112.9 mph to 116.5 mph. At last week’s PGA Championship, the 74 players who made the cut averaged an impressive 117.9 mph CHS.

However, compared to their male peers, players on the LPGA Tour have always seemed to favor accuracy over speed.

LPGA Tour players hit an incredible percentage of their fairways. Too many, perhaps.

There are 12 women on the LPGA Tour averaging an astounding 80% or greater fairways hit. By comparison, Aaron Rai is the leader in driving accuracy on the PGA TOUR at 73%, with just four other men at 70% or higher.

Driving accuracy can be a messy statistic. A golfer could miss a fairway by a foot or blow their tee shot OB, but both shots count as a missed fairway. Also, because it doesn't consider distance, not all fairways hit are equal in terms of their impact on scoring potential. Stokes Gained: Off-The-Tee, however, is much more representative of driving performance.

When considering the BEST (not just most accuracte) drivers on the LPGA, elite distance seems to be more important than elite accuracy. Of the top 10 in SG:OTT on the LPGA Tour, only three have a driving accuracy above 70% (which ranks 92nd on the LPGA Tour). However, of those 10, all are in the top 42 in average driving distance.

It seems as if many LPGA players could benefit from sacrificing some accuracy for more distance.

This was a conclusion from our session with Gaby Lopez.

When she came to TPI last winter with her coach, Horacio Morales, and trainer, Janet Alexander, she said she had three driver speeds: fairway finder, faster and fastest (she called it her ""King Kong""). She liked swinging all out (King Kong), but felt like her mechanics were inefficient. The data confirmed it.

When Greg looked at her King Kong swing, he loved the intent, but saw that her ground reaction forces could be optimized to help improve her ability to transfer force to the club.

Gabby‘s lower body is a rocket ship. She has tremendous physical ability. It shows up in the gym, in our power testing (22” countermovement jump) and on our force plates (over 220% bodyweight vertical force with her driver).

That said, after looking at her kinetics, it was clear she was generating her forces too late. This is one of the key lessons we focus on in our advanced Power and Golf Certification courses. Timing of force can be just as important as magnitude. If you’re too late, you don’t have opportunity to transfer the energy to the club.

One of the hallmarks of elite ball strikers is that they tend to generate ground reaction forces much earlier than higher handicappers.

By teaching Gaby to push against the ground earlier in the downswing, she developed more efficient mechanics, both in terms of power and consistency.

Gaby’s driver has always been a strength, but in 2025 it’s become a weapon.

Consider this progression:

In 2023, Gaby ranked 49th on the LPGA Tour in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee (0.19 per round), averaging 262 yards and finding 71% of the fairways.

In 2024, Gaby rose to 28th in SG:OTT (0.41 per round), averaging 264 yards and finding 75% of the fairways.

In 2025, Gaby is sitting at 4th in SG:OTT (0.79), averaging a career-best 277 yards with 68% accuracy.

Essentially, by adding 13 yards and only losing 7% accuracy, it means that Gaby is one club closer off-the-tee 14 times per round while only missing one more fairway per round. Obviously, this is a tremendous statistical advantage.

This more evidence that speed is a skill. It is trainable, but requires intention and attention.

If we don’t practice top speed, how can we expect to control top speed? As Greg says in the video, it’s tough to survive in the jungle if you were raised in the zoo.

Our assessment with 2019 RSM Classic champion, Tyler Duncan, featured one of the most common Body-Swing Connections we see in golf.

Tyler came in with his trainer, Mike Chistman of Fit Garage Indianapolis, and his coach, Andrew Johnson. After taking Tyler through our physical screen, we noticed he had difficulty rotating in the backswing due to limited hip and thoracic spine mobility (identified through our Lower Quarter Rotation and Seated Trunk Rotation tests). In order to get the club to the top, Tyler compensates by leaning his spine towards the target, a swing characteristic we call Reverse Spine Angle.

Instead of turning, he tilts. As Greg says in the video, it's like a ""fake turn.""

Not only can Reverse Spine Angle create excessive stress on the lower back, it was causing attack angle and spin loft issues.

Tyler complained of difficulty controlling spin with his wedges. There are only two things that create spin: clubhead speed and spin loft. Spin loft is a product of dynamic loft and attack angle. Here's a quick explainer video from our online Golf Level 2 course:

Since Tyler was tilting his spine towards the target, his angle of attack was more negative, creating excessive spin loft.

Towards the end of the video, you'll see Greg trying to teach him to rotate into his backswing. The movement pattern felt unnatural to Tyler, in part, because of physical restrictions in his thoracic spine.

As Greg said, he made a mistake that rookie coaches commonly do. He was asking a player to do something he could not physically do.

As with every assessment at TPI, Tyler's Body-Swing Connection told a story. The movement patterns in his swing were developed around his physical limitations. Without performing a ten minute movement screen to better understand his movement capabilities, we'd have no idea if our recommendations would complement what he could physically do.

Assess, don't guess.

Chiara Noja is one of the most exciting young golfers in the women’s game. A teenage phenom, she became the youngest ever champion on the Ladies European Tour after winning the Aramco Team Series - Jeddah at just 16 years old.

Chiara came to us last year while recovering from a shoulder injury. Whenever we’re working with a golfer who is dealing with an injury, our first priority is to identify whether the swing could be part of the problem.

Due to the highly repetitive nature of golf, injuries are often the product of an accumulation of stress. We can’t eliminate the risk of injury, but we can work to eliminate excessive stress.

One of the goals of our advanced Medical courses is to help rehab professionals understand common injury-inducing mechanisms in the swing. In our experience, swing characteristics that limit the contribution of a body part tend be more demanding of other areas, often resulting in breakdown. After all, what does the work is what tends to hurt.

With three top-25 finishes in his last five starts, Jeremy Paul is finding his form in his rookie season on the PGA TOUR.

When Jeremy came to TPI for an assessment last fall, data from our physical screen and force plates not only revealed opportunities to improve distance potential, but identified one of the most common misconceptions we see in short game technique.

Physical Assessment Insights

One of the benefits of assessing golfers is it often reveals potential gaps in their physical training. When we physically screened Jeremy, we found a few limitations in mobility as well as a reduction in power, despite demonstrating above-average strength.

We don't view this as a concern, we see it as an opportunity.

Of the thousands of elite golfers we put through our Level 1 screen, only a handful have passed every test. The screen isn’t predictive of skill, but an evaluation of movement capabilities. Failing a screen doesn’t mean they can’t play great golf, it just suggests where they might need to focus in the gym or how their coach might want to consider adapting their swing to complement their movement.

When done properly, strength training should actually improve mobility. As Dr. Rose mentions in the video, Olympic weightlifters are not only some of the most powerful athletes in the world, but also some of the most mobile. Additionally, because strength was up and power was down, Jeremy might want to consider adding more ballistic exercises to his routine or reducing weight and reps in favor of greater velocity. Developing power requires intent. To paraphrase Dr. Andy Galpin in our Power Level 2 online course, exercises will not improve power unless they are performed powerfully. ""Exercises themselves don't determine adaptation."" ""Exercises themselves don't determine adaptation.”

If the PGA TOUR’s Creator Classic was any indication, golf’s YouTube era has officially arrived. According to the Sports Business Journal, Golf YouTube is responsible for BILLIONS of views on the platform every year. One of the most popular players on the platform who didn’t tee it up this week is Micah Morris.

With over 500,000 subscribers and approaching 100 million views on his channel, Micah is not only one of the most talented creators in golf, he's one of the most talented players as well.

Micah recently came to TPI for a full assessment which revealed one of the most commons Body-Swing Connections we see in golf.

Micah’s Body-Swing Connection

Micah was fighting the dreaded two-way miss with his driver, complaining of “difficulty getting to his lead side.” When we screened him and evaluated his swing mechanics, we identified a very clear Body-Swing Connection.

Micah is a terrific athlete and performed extremely well on our screen. However, when we tested his ability to internally rotate with our Lower Quarter Rotation test, we found a significant limitation. He did not like to turn into his lead side. Instead of rotating into his lead leg, he preferred to thrust towards the target line. The dreaded early extension.

Below is a screen capture of the Pelvis Position graphs from Micah's 3D data. The green line represents thrust, or the pelvis moving towards and away from the target line.

When the green line goes positive, the pelvis is moving towards the target line. At impact, Micah has moved forward over 2.5 inches, representing early extension.

As with any golfer we meet, our first goal is to determine whether a swing characteristic is the product of technique, or if it could be influenced by their physical capabilities.

In Micah's case, there's a high likelihood that his early extension and inability to move to the lead side were related to his limited internal rotation on his left side. Greg and Dave explain:

Potential Swing Fix

Whenever we identify a potential Body-Swing Connection, we give a golfer two choices: 1) adopt a routine to address their physical limitations in the gym, and/or 2) explore technical changes that will make it easier for them to work around their physical limitations.

As Greg and Dave demonstrate in the video below, simple set up changes are some of the least invasive and most effective strategies for working around limited internal rotation.

Micah said it in the video: ""I look at my swing a lot, I’ve just never looked at my body.""

He’s young, he’s fit and he’s mega-athletic but that doesn’t mean there aren’t potential physical issues that are inhibiting his swing. By identifying those physical issues, we not only help explain why he struggles to get to his lead side, we outline a path to improvement through work in the gym and on the range.",[],,www.mytpi.com,"Micah Morris Analyzing the Body-Swing Connection of the YouTube Star If the PGA TOURs Creator Classic was any indication, golfs YouTube era has officially arrived.

When we screened him and evaluated his swing mechanics, we identified a very clear Body-Swing Connection. Micah is a terrific athlete and performed extremely well on our screen. However, when we tested his ability to internally rotate with our Lower Quarter Rotation test, we found a significant limitation. He did not like to turn into his lead side. Instead of rotating into his lead leg, he preferred to thrust towards the target line. The dreaded early extension. Below is a screen capture of the Pelvis Position graphs from Micahs 3D data. The green line represents thrust, or the pelvis moving towards and away from the target line. When the green line goes positive, the pelvis is moving towards the target line. At impact, Micah has moved forward over 2.5 inches, representing early extension. As with any golfer we meet, our first goal is to determine whether a swing characteristic is the product of technique, or if it could be influenced by their physical capabilities. In Micahs case, theres a high likelihood that his early extension and inability to move to the lead side were related to his limited internal rotation on his left side. Greg and Dave explain Potential Swing Fix Whenever we identify a potential Body-Swing Connection, we give a golfer two choices 1 adopt a routine to address their physical limitations in the gym, andor 2 explore technical changes that will make it easier for them to work around their physical limitations. As Greg and Dave demonstrate in the video below, simple set up changes are some of the least invasive and most effective strategies for working around limited internal rotation. Micah said it in the video I look at my swing a lot, Ive just never looked at my body. Hes young, hes fit and hes mega-athletic but that doesnt mean there arent potential physical issues that are inhibiting his swing. By identifying those physical issues, we not only help explain why he struggles to get to his lead side, we outline a path to improvement through work in the gym and on the range.","['Micah Morris Analyzing the Body-Swing Connection of the YouTube Star If the PGA TOURs Creator Classic was any indication, golfs YouTube era has officially arrived.

13-year-old Ananyaa Sood of Dubai is among the most-skilled young golfers we’ve evaluated in the last few years. Her coordination, speed and maturity bely her age and her tournament results reflect it:

The week after visiting TPI, she finished 2nd at the US Kids Championship in the 13-year old division and the following month she won the inaugural Tommy Fleetwood International Pathway Series event.

While Ananyaa has the benefit of working with a world-class team, including her coach, Sujjan Singh, and trainer, Allister Parlane, we felt like there are several lessons that junior golf parents, coaches and trainers can take from our experience with her.

Don’t Wait to Evaluate

Our system is sport specific, not age specific. We don’t wait until a golfer is an adult to evaluate what they can do physically. In fact, in many cases, it makes more sense to evaluate a teenager. Kids develop at different rates. Chronological age is often not the same as biological age in young athletes (this concept is the foundation behind the skill and movement-based developmental criteria that we introduce in our advanced Junior courses).

Golf is a game of skill. The golf ball doesn’t care how much hip mobility you have, it only responds to the force applied by the club during impact. That said, the earlier we can help a golfer develop robust movement skills or identify potential limitations, the better opportunity they will have to develop a more repeatable and powerful pattern.

Ananyaa is already developing strength and movement skills in the weightroom under the supervision of an elite team, but, if she wants to play professionally, she still has work to do to match the physical capacity of her future competition.

Caution around the weight room is a common - and understandble - concern of parents of young golfers, however, the vast majority of juniors we meet have waited too long to begin training.

A golfer’s body is the 15th club in their bag. Why would we want to wait to develop it or to determine if it is limiting their ability to express a skill?

Don’t Let Competition Get in the Way of Development

We love to see junior golfers playing competitively. As coaches or parents, our first goal with junior golfers should be to help them develop a passion for the game, and playing golf - including tournament golf - is much more addicting than beating balls on a range.

That said, we believe that competition results should never take priority over a young golfer’s athletic and skill development.

If a golfer (or their parent or coach) feels they have limited resources to practice or train (whether time, money or energy) because of a busy tournament schedule, it’s a losing strategy. Short-term results should never supersede long-term goals.

As Greg said at the end of the video:

“When you meet someone with your golf skills who can hit it 100 yards past you, how are you going to feel? Trouble.”

Competitive rounds are valuable tools for developing a passion and highlighting learning opportunities, but should not be prioritized at the expense of physical or technical development.

Too Long, Too Heavy, Too Soon

In our evaluation with Ananyaa, we hypothesized that the weight of her clubs could be contributing to the compensations we saw in her swing, specifically loss of posture. Her coach, Sujjan, mentioned her mechanics improved when she tried lighter clubs. Though any adjustment with Ananyaa's fitting would be subtle, this feedback underscores an important potential pitfall in junior golf.

Some of the most common and egregious fitting mistakes we see are with parents setting up their young golfers. Too long, too heavy, too soon.

Gifting your kid your old driver can be a disaster for their game.



Junior golfer who swing clubs that are too long or too heavy can often develop poor mechanics and even increase risk of injury.

Golfers come in all shapes and sizes, but South Africa’s rising star, Christo Lamprecht, is a definitely outlier. At 6’8”, he’s not only one of the tallest professional golfers in the world, he’s also one of the fastest.

With mid-190’s ball speed (and a ceiling of ~210 mph), Christo is already one of the premier athletes in golf and his blend of tremendous physical gifts, unique mechanics and elite power make him a fascinating case study.

Whether you work with golfers for a living or are interested in improving your own game, there's plenty to learn from studying an outlier like Christo.

Characteristics, Not Faults In our Level 1 course, we’re intentional about referring to potential mechanical inefficiencies in swings as characteristics, not faults. They are elements which make a swing unique, but not necessarily ineffective. Name any characteristic and we’ll point to a dozen players on various tours who have it. That said, understanding how characteristics may be related to physical limitations and how they can inhibit a golfer’s efficiency can help guide recommendations related to training or technique. Christo has a characteristic we refer to as Late Buckle. Normally, after a player makes contact with the ball and the club releases around their body, there is a corresponding lift or standing tall into the finish position. A Late Buckle is when a player actually dips down and drops after making contact with the ball. In Christo’s case, his late buckle may be a necessary compensation to deliver the club to the ball at his height, especially with more lofted, shorter irons. In transition, Christo squats down several inches, but, unlike most elite ball strikers we evaluate, he doesn’t raise his pelvis vertically during the downswing. It’s likely a primary reason why his vertical force was slightly lower than our PGA TOUR average (190% bodyweight vs 198%), despite his prodigious speed. There was a potential Body-Swing Connection here, as well. We identified a limitation in internal hip mobility on the left side. If internal rotation is limited on the downswing, a golfer may be more likely to slide or buckle, instead of turn. As Dr. Rose says in the video, we want to be careful with unique swings. His kinematic sequence was incredible and he definitely doesn’t need more speed. Our goal was to make him aware of how the characteristic can affect his consistency and highlight how his body could be a contributing factor.

Athlete First

Christo is an impressive athlete, regardless of height. He grew up playing multiple sports such as rugby and soccer, only choosing to specialize in golf as a teenager. This, along with consistent training, has helped develop some of the physical tools which underpin his speed.

Despite weighing (a lean) 240 lbs, Christo’s countermovement jump measured over 4” higher than our PGA TOUR average. His potential to generate force with his lower body is immense. Additionally, he performed extremely well on our movement screen. His range of motion and motor control is terrific in most areas, especially impressive for an athlete of his size.

While it’s entirely possible to play great golf with poor movement capabilities or power potential, it is not an optimal strategy for maximizing performance and durability.

Christo has worked to make his physicality an asset. It needs to be, too. The torque he produced on our force plates was as high as any golfer in our database. Total torque is highly correlated with speed, but it can also be an indication of stress on the body. Developing capacity and maintaining mobility is important for all golfers, but especially for one with such a powerful, unique move.

Ramp Time

Christo is a poster-child for a concept we like to refer to as “ramp time.” As we discuss in our advanced Power courses, to improve speed, golfers can either apply more force to the grip or apply that force for a longer period of time. A longer backswing gives golfers more of a runway to generate speed.

In fact, research from Dr. Sasho Mackenzie suggests that if a golfer were to lengthen their backswing by just 4” they could increase their club head speed by an additional 2.4 mph. While we can’t create taller golfers, it underscores the importance of helping them develop longer backswings by improving mobility in the gym or technique on the lesson tee (such as lifting the lead heel).

It didn't matter if Christo was 4'8"" or 6'8"", our process would remain the same. We want to evaluate what he does, how he does it and explore reasons why he might do it that way. From here we're able to make more qualified recommendations related to his coaching, training or treatment.",[],,www.mytpi.com,"Christo Lamprecht Under The Hood of One of The Fastest Swings in Golf Golfers come in all shapes and sizes, but South Africas rising star, Christo Lamprecht, is a definitely outlier.

Our latest video featuring Joel Dahmen during his visit to TPI ahead of the 2025 season not only will confirm why he's a fan favorite on the PGA TOUR, but should highlight several things every golfer can do to improve their game.

Here are three lessons you or your golfers can learn from our assessment with Joel:

Consistent Pre-Shot Process

At the start of the video, Joel mentioned that he was very consistent with his driver, but struggled with his short-game. Something that stood out about his approach to both was that he had a consistent pre-shot process with his driver, but not with his short-game.

In both practice and play, a consistent process is critical for skill acquisition and performance. As Dr. Rose likes to say:

“Quality practice is not about how many balls you hit, it’s about how many processes you run.”

Practice should make a golfer mentally tired, not just physically tired.

Is Power Limited By the Engine, Equipment or Technique

The primary goal of the power assessment we teach in our advanced Fitness and Power courses is to determine if a golfer’s speed is limited by their technique, their equipment or their physical capacity. If a golfer swinging as fast as their technique and equipment allows, we know we need to improve their ability to express power physically.

Some golfers can improve speed by addressing technique, equipment or intent, but others won’t get faster until they increase the size of their engine.



Here’s Dr. Rose from Power Level 3. pic.twitter.com/dIgkcvpHit — TPI (@MyTPI) July 20, 2022

In the video, Dr. Rose cautions Joel about using overspeed/overload training devices. We’ve been massive proponents of this strategy for the last decade and, while the training devices are incredibly effective, we advise athletes to build a solid foundation of strength and movement quality before rushing to train speed.

Training an athlete for power is like building a skyscraper. To build the tallest skyscraper, we want to establish a solid foundation. Our Level 1 and Power screens help identify if there are any cracks in the foundation.

Down in Chipping

If you’ve been following our feed recently, you might be familiar with this concept. It’s one of the more compelling insights we’ve uncovered from evaluating force plate data from hundreds of professional golfers over the last few years.

When we measured Joel's center of mass while chipping, we noticed it was dropping in the downswing. This is something we often see in golfers who complain of inconsistent contact in their short game.

In chipping, we look at the lower body as the foundation and the hands as the technique. If the foundation is unstable, the technique will suffer.

Down is death in your short game.

In this video’s “PGA TOUR players are not like the rest of us” moment, Joel hit the stick from 20 yards away twice in a row after applying the feel of not going down. Like all TOUR players, he is wildly talented and extremely hard-working. The goal of our assessments is to make sure he's working on the right things.

At just 20 years old, South African Aldrich Potgieter is leading the PGA TOUR in average driving distance. We had the opportunity to evaluate Aldrich in our lab and wanted to highlight some of the key kinetic and kinematic data behind his prodigious speed:

Total Torque: Total torque is one of the kinetic variables most-closely associated with clubhead speed. Essentially, it tells us how well a golfers ""twists"" in the frontal, sagittal and horizontal planes. Unsurprisingly, Aldrich creates as much total torque as any TOUR player we've evaluated.

Timing: If you've followed our content for any period of time, you're probably familiar with this topic. While measuring the magnitude of ground reaction forces is important, how much force a golfer generates almost doesn't matter if the timing is too late. Aldrich's vertical force peaks extremely early in the downswing, giving him more time to transfer that energy to the club. Most higher-handicappers we evaluate generate their force much later than him.

Shoulder Turn: In order to generate more clubhead speed, a golfer can either apply more average force or apply that force for a longer time (a longer hand path). We like to refer to it as ""ramp time."" Aldrich makes a large shoulder turn, which allows him a longer ramp to accelerate the club.

X-Factor: As we outlined in our article about our assessment with Patrick Cantlay, too much x-factor can be a bad thing. However, if a golfer isn't able to create separation between their upper body and lower body, they won't be able to engage their oblique abdominals which are a key contributor to torso rotation velocity. Aldrich creates excellent separation of his upper body and lower body, a hallmark of elite rotational athletes.

Lag: We generally don't coach or cue ""lag."" We see it as a product of quality movement. If we see issues with lag (or casting), we usually look at the lower body first as improving sequence (starting downswing with lower body) is often a long-term solve. Aldrich has a beautiful kinematic sequence and does a terrific job initiating the downswing with the lower body, which helps him set the club.

Aldrich came in a few weeks after carding a 59 at a Korn Ferry Tour event. His game was dialed and the data reflected it. After hours of poking and proding, Dave and Greg had one major takeaway: ""Don't change a thing.""

Had an opportunity to assess Aldrich in our lab last spring, a few weeks after he shot 59 on the @KornFerryTour.

https://www.mytpi.com/articles/swing/tom-hoge-wanted-more-speed-here's-how-we-helped-him-find-it,Tom Hoge Wanted More Speed - Here's How We Helped Him Find It,"Tom Hoge Wanted More Speed - Here's How We Helped Him Find It

Tom Hoge wants 190 mph ball speed. At least, that’s the running joke between him and his coach, Scott Hamilton. Scott, one of the best coaches in the world, would be happy with 175 mph, but Tom is determined to prove that he can touch 190.

While 190 mph is probably not necessary, Tom could benefit from adding a few mph. This year, he ranks 158th in Strokes Gained: Off The Tee, while cruising at 170 mph ball speed (PGA TOUR average is 174 mph). Since ball speed is so closely related to driving performance, we knew we wanted to look for ways we could cheat some more speed out of his swing.

After evaluating his physical capabilities, force and 3D data, we identified three opportunities to improve his scoring potential off the tee.

The Driver is a “Specialty Shot”

We believe there is a misconception that golfers only have one swing. ""Specialty shots"" like a flop shot and chip shot have significantly different mechanics from a stock 7-iron. Similarly, we believe the driver is a specialty shot.

Tom is an ELITE iron player, ranking 18th in SG: Approach in 2025 and 4th in SG: Approach in 2024. However, the mechanics that make him great with an iron don’t necessarily benefit him with a driver.

While an iron is struck with a descending blow (negative attack angle), the best drivers in the world typically have a positive attack angle. Therefore, swinging a driver with “iron mechanics” might not be efficient, especially if hoping to generate significant speed.

One of the most effective and least invasive strategies to encourage a positive angle of attack is to adjust set up. We call it plumb bob. Here's Greg explaining it in our Power Level 3 course:

Many amateur golfers try to tilt their upper body to feel loaded into their trail leg or achieve attack angle, but this tends to move the center of their pelvis in front of the center of their stance at set up. pic.twitter.com/VlBFLu5ffQ — TPI (@MyTPI) March 20, 2023

Load to Explode

“You can’t shut a shut door.”

If you’ve watched our channel this last year, you’ve probably heard that line from Greg. He’s referring to players who stay on their lead leg in the backswing instead of loading into the trail leg. If all of their pressure is towards the target in the backswing, they have no incentive to drive that way in transition.

In evaluating Tom’s force plate data, it was clear that lateral force was low relative to our PGA TOUR average. While vertical force and torque are most closely associated with club head speed, lateral force is critical for adding energy to the system. Consider why a pitcher strides down the mound or why a quarterback steps into a throw.

Greg was encouraging Tom to load more onto his trail side so that he could drive to the lead side.

New Swing, New Driver Specs

It should be a crime for any golfer to play with poorly fit equipment. In terms of improving golf performance, optimizing equipment is the easy button. Gym work is hard. Swing work is hard. Equipment changes are easy.

Tom came in with a driver that was perfectly dialed for his swing, but after Greg’s recommendations changed his attack angle, he needed different settings to optimize launch and spin loft.

This video from our Golf Level 2 online course highlights the importance of spin loft and how we can control it:

Managing Spin Loft can unlock more distance without more speed.



Spin Loft is the difference between Dynamic Loft and Angle of Attack. Increasing the Angle of Attack can reduce Spin Loft which will decrease spin rate and increase distance.

Whenever we evaluate a golfer, we’re always looking at WHAT they are doing, HOW they are doing it, and WHY they might do it that way. To see what they are doing, we use video and 3D motion capture. To understand how they are doing it, we look at force plate data. And to connect the why, we take them through our physical screen.

Our recent evaluation of 2023 European Amatuer champion and Arizona State standout, Jose Ballester, was a fascinating case study in how this data can reveal unique strategies among the most effective swings in the world.

Jose is a tremendous ball-striker with elite speed, but he does it differently than most of the players we see.

When we dug into Jose’s 3D, force and physical data, it revealed his “superpowers,” specifically his ability to lag the club on the downswing and create something called moment arm by how he pushes against the ground.

Dr. Rose explains in the latest case study from our lab:

When we evaluate ground reaction forces in a golf swing, HOW and WHEN an athlete pushes against the ground can be just as important as HOW HARD.

The most powerful golfers in the world not only create a lot of force, they do it earlier in the downswing than slower players. Most of the research suggests that we want to maximize vertical force at shaft vertical downswing (or lead arm parallel). Jose, like most high-clubhead speed players, does this well.

What’s particularly unique about Jose’s kinetic data is that he “only” generates around 150% of his total bodyweight in vertical force on the downswing. The PGA TOUR average in our database is almost 200%. Being one of the faster players in golf, we would’ve expected him to be higher.

So how does he create so much torque while applying less force than his peers? He has a longer moment arm.

This is a concept we discuss in-depth in our Power and Golf Level 3 seminars. While it should probably never be a player's swing thought, moment arm is an important variable to understand.

Probably the easiest way to think about moment arm is to imagine loosening a nut with a wrench. If you were given an option to rotate a nut with a wrench that had a 1” long handle or one with a 12” long handle, which would you choose? The 12” handle, right? This is because the longer handle allows us to apply force further from the center of rotation (the nut). The longer wrench creates the potential for a longer moment arm.

Similarly, by positioning his body to push against the ground further from his center of rotation, Jose “creates a long wrench.” His moment arm was 13"" whereas our PGA TOUR average is about 6"".

Again, optimizing ground reaction forces in golfers is about how they push, not just how hard.

This is another example of how we try to understand how a golfer’s physical capabilities match what they’re doing in their swing.

It’s the goal of our Level 1 and advanced course curriculum and what you can expect in an evaluation with a TPI Certified expert near you.

Before making recommendations related to a golfer’s technique, training or treatment, we want to consider their WHAT, HOW and WHY.

When studying the kinetics of the most powerful and effective ball-strikers on the planet, one of the characteristics that separates elite players from high-handicappers isn't just how much force the generate, but how soon they do it in the downswing.

This is one of the key concepts that we discuss in our Power Level 2 course and our Power Level 3 seminar (above). Whether creating a feel in the gym or analyzing ground reaction force data, we want to help golfers learn to push against the ground (especially with their lead foot) earlier in the downswing.

After all, it doesn’t really matter what kind of power a golfer can generate if they don’t apply force early enough to contribute to the angular velocity of the club.

Below are examples of how PGA National Teacher of the Year Mark Blackburn and five-time World Long Drive Champion Jason Zuback help golfers improve power potential by optimizing ground reaction force in the gym and on the range.

https://golftipsmag.com/instruction/full-swing/,Full Swing -,"We have all heard it. When getting information about aim and alignment, we often hear to “finish your swing facing your target.” Don’t do it — you will likely hit a shot that will not end up on line. You need to finish your swing facing LEFT of the target.

Look at all the Tour pros out there, including Jessica Korda (above): They are clearly facing well left of their target at the finish, and that goes all the way back to proper set-up and address. Here’s how to put it all together:

AIM AND ALIGNMENT

First, place your hands on the grip, keeping the clubface square.

Then, aim the square clubface to the target on the line you established from behind the ball. The leading edge of your golf club will be at a right angle to the target line.

Next, align your body (checking feet, thighs, hips, and shoulders) parallel and left of the target line, addressing the golf ball.

If you feel as if you are really left of your target, you will be aligned correctly. Do not align your body to the target…aim your club at the target and align your body left of the target! (For left-handers — right of the target)

Last, with confidence, trust your aim and alignment and make your best effort to create the shot. Even if you do not hit it perfectly, it will likely be on line, heading towards the intended target—a great miss!

COMPLETE YOUR SWING

This is accurate information: Left is “Right” (correct) at address. However, finishing with your belt buckle facing the target line is stopping short of the full completion of the swing circle.

When you finish a good golf swing, your belt buckle will actually be facing LEFT of your target if you have completed the swing circle. The ball will track towards the target on the line you established in your pre-shot routine, but your body will not finish facing the target. If it does, it could result in a shot that leaks to the right of the intended target.

Think in terms of the two lines at address that might help you understand this critical piece of information relating to the completion of your golf swing motion.

Imagine that the target line is the “ball target” and the parallel line you have lined up your body on is the “body target.” The two lines are parallel at address and remain so during the swing motion, but it is just the golf ball that (hopefully) ends up on the “ball target” line you established.

Ideally, you will end up in a balanced finish position, facing the “body target” line you set at address, clearly left of the ball target line. The swing circle motion has been completed, allowing both the operator and the equipment to hit a shot “on line” to the target!

Understanding this very thing has been instrumental for improved aim, alignment, and result with my students. See if this perception change alters the directional reality of your golf shots.

As my students and I often say about these actions that improve your motion and game, “If you can, you MUST!”

– Perfect Golf Swing –

This section was designed to give golfers illustrated swing tips on how to swing a golf club, to present the textbook version of “the perfect golf swing”, essentially.

It also provides information on how golfers can deviate from that perfect golf swing and instead veer towards golf swing errors. The information is broken down into the components that make up a golf swing and comparative illustrations are used in order to quickly highlight key differences.

Use these illustrated guides for quick but detailed help on how to improve your golf swing and its many components.

The address and setup stage of the golf swing involves assuming the correct position before the swing actually starts. There are many elements to consider and overlooking key areas at the start will snowball into issues down the line.

Among other things, the club should rest flat behind the ball. It should be held by the golfer with hands flowing straight down from the shoulders. The knees should be comfortably bent and the upper body tilted forward and straight. The right hand being lower than the left will put the shoulders on an upward slope. The weight is evenly divided between the two feet and rests mostly on the ball of the feet.

Finally, the shaft of the club is angled forward slightly, the clubface is perpendicular to the target and the feet are parallel to the target line.

The takeaway portion of the golf swing begins as soon as the club starts moving back and ends when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground. During that short period of time, several critical moves must happen in order to put the swing on a good track.

Indeed, the club should be taken back square so that the shaft points at the target when it is parallel to the ground. At the same time, the clubface should point down slightly and wrists shouldn’t be allowed to hinge this early in the swing.

Go to:

Takeaway Swing Tips

The backswing portion of the golf swing begins just as the takeaway ends. It will end itself when the top of the swing is reached. While getting there, several aspects need careful attention.

The left arm should remain straight and the left heel should remain on the ground unless flexibility issues demand otherwise. The right knee should retain its flex and the left knee should point towards the ball. Hips rotate but they do so without sliding back. While the head stays in the box, the weight still flows towards the right foot. This whole process should proceed at a pace that is slower than that of the downswing in order to produce a solid strike at the ball.

Go to:

Backswing Tips

The top of the golf swing corresponds to the halfway point between the address position and the moment of impact. It represents the position when your hands are highest and the transition point between the backswing and the downswing.

The left wrist should be flat at the top and your spine angle should still resemble the one set at address. The shaft of the club should point towards the target and it should be just shy of parallel to the ground. Your back should face the target and your wrists should be fully hinged.

Go to:

Top of the Swing Tips

The downswing portion of the golf swing corresponds to the stage immediately following the top of the swing, as the hands and club are brought down towards the impact with the ball.

Your hips should move first by starting to uncoil but they should do so without sliding forward much. They should allow for the smooth weight transition towards the front left foot as your shoulders uncoil in tandem. The hinge in your wrists are kept for as long as possible and your clubhead should follow a path that allows it to be square with the target at impact, the next stage. This whole process should be executed at a noticeably faster pace than the one used to bring the club up.

Go to:

Downswing Tips

The moment of impact is the only point in time when your body – through the golf club – will actually come in contact with the ball or exert any influence on it. Despite the long journey that precedes it, there are still key elements to focus on in order to promote a pure strike at the ball in what should be a straight shot.

Hands should be ahead of the ball at impact. Your spine forward bend should closely match the one set at address still. Your eyes should be trained on the ball and your hips and hands should be facing the target, or well on their way. An impact made with an iron should be made on a downward motion while one made with a wood should be made after the club has reached the lowest point of the swing arc, as the clubhead is rising.

Go to:

Impact Swing Tips

The release and extension sequence of the golf swing occurs after impact with the ball. It corresponds to the phase that precedes the final golf position, i.e., the follow through.

The term extension comes from the fact that both of your arms should be fully extended during the release. Furthermore, your spine angle should be identical to that of the impact position, implying that you should resist the urge to straighten your body. Your forearms and hands, which started to ‘roll’ during the downswing will complete their rotation, with the bottom hand on the club now leading your top hand towards the target.

Go to:

Release Swing Tips

Despite taking place after contact with the ball has already been made the way your body is positioned during the follow through will be indicative of the motions that preceded it. And focusing on reaching a desirable follow through position will help you perform the previous golf swing stages correctly.

Among other things, your hands should release naturally after the wrists are allowed to unhinge. Your hands and clubhead should circle back around your body as your body weight is moved towards the left foot. Finally, your hips should be facing the target and you should resist the urge to quit swinging after the club has hit the ball. Instead a full follow through, proud and high is sought.

Go to:

Follow Through Swing Tips

Your driver is built differently than your other golf clubs. Also, it makes contact with the ball while the ball is held up from the ground on a tee. As such, there are key differences between how you hit golf shots using your irons and wedges vs how you hit a drive using your driver.

As far as the address position is concerned, the ball will be located further forward in your stance, in line with the instep of your front foot. This position will allow the driver to ‘hit up on the ball’, as the club is rising from its lowest point of the swing arc.

Since your driver likely features a longer shaft than your other golf clubs, the ball will be located further away from your feet. With your hands addressing the ball forward, your spine angle will be tilted back slightly, with a little more than half of your weight located atop your back foot.

In order to hit the ball far down the fairway, your driver swing will likely be as long as your physical abilities allow. This is in contrast to a wedge shot where precision is preferred over distance. You should also allow your swing plane to be flatter, again in contrast to your wedges and because of the longer club shaft.

Your forearms and hands, which started to roll during the downswing will complete their rotation, with the bottom hand on the club now leading your top hand towards the target. Go to Release Swing Tips Despite taking place after contact with the ball has already been made the way your body is positioned during the follow through will be indicative of the motions that preceded it. And focusing on reaching a desirable follow through position will help you perform the previous golf swing stages correctly. Among other things, your hands should release naturally after the wrists are allowed to unhinge. Your hands and clubhead should circle back around your body as your body weight is moved towards the left foot. Finally, your hips should be facing the target and you should resist the urge to quit swinging after the club has hit the ball. Instead a full follow through, proud and high is sought. Go to Follow Through Swing Tips Your driver is built differently than your other golf clubs. Also, it makes contact with the ball while the ball is held up from the ground on a tee. As such, there are key differences between how you hit golf shots using your irons and wedges vs how you hit a drive using your driver. As far as the address position is concerned, the ball will be located further forward in your stance, in line with the instep of your front foot. This position will allow the driver to hit up on the ball, as the club is rising from its lowest point of the swing arc. Since your driver likely features a longer shaft than your other golf clubs, the ball will be located further away from your feet. With your hands addressing the ball forward, your spine angle will be tilted back slightly, with a little more than half of your weight located atop your back foot. In order to hit the ball far down the fairway, your driver swing will likely be as long as your physical abilities allow. This is in contrast to a wedge shot where precision is preferred over distance. You should also allow your swing plane to be flatter, again in contrast to your wedges and because of the longer club shaft.

The information is broken down into the components that make up a golf swing and comparative illustrations are used in order to quickly highlight key differences. Use these illustrated guides for quick but detailed help on how to improve your golf swing and its many components. The address and setup stage of the golf swing involves assuming the correct position before the swing actually starts. There are many elements to consider and overlooking key areas at the start will snowball into issues down the line. Among other things, the club should rest flat behind the ball. It should be held by the golfer with hands flowing straight down from the shoulders. The knees should be comfortably bent and the upper body tilted forward and straight. The right hand being lower than the left will put the shoulders on an upward slope. The weight is evenly divided between the two feet and rests mostly on the ball of the feet. Finally, the shaft of the club is angled forward slightly, the clubface is perpendicular to the target and the feet are parallel to the target line. The takeaway portion of the golf swing begins as soon as the club starts moving back and ends when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground. During that short period of time, several critical moves must happen in order to put the swing on a good track. Indeed, the club should be taken back square so that the shaft points at the target when it is parallel to the ground. At the same time, the clubface should point down slightly and wrists shouldnt be allowed to hinge this early in the swing. Go to Takeaway Swing Tips The backswing portion of the golf swing begins just as the takeaway ends. It will end itself when the top of the swing is reached. While getting there, several aspects need careful attention. The left arm should remain straight and the left heel should remain on the ground unless flexibility issues demand otherwise. The right knee should retain its flex and the left knee should point towards the ball. Hips rotate but they do so without sliding back. While the head stays in the box, the weight still flows towards the right foot. This whole process should proceed at a pace that is slower than that of the downswing in order to produce a solid strike at the ball. Go to Backswing Tips The top of the golf swing corresponds to the halfway point between the address position and the moment of impact. It represents the position when your hands are highest and the transition point between the backswing and the downswing. The left wrist should be flat at the top and your spine angle should still resemble the one set at address. The shaft of the club should point towards the target and it should be just shy of parallel to the ground. Your back should face the target and your wrists should be fully hinged. Go to Top of the Swing Tips The downswing portion of the golf swing corresponds to the stage immediately following the top of the swing, as the hands and club are brought down towards the impact with the ball. Your hips should move first by starting to uncoil but they should do so without sliding forward much. They should allow for the smooth weight transition towards the front left foot as your shoulders uncoil in tandem. The hinge in your wrists are kept for as long as possible and your clubhead should follow a path that allows it to be square with the target at impact, the next stage. This whole process should be executed at a noticeably faster pace than the one used to bring the club up. Go to Downswing Tips The moment of impact is the only point in time when your body through the golf club will actually come in contact with the ball or exert any influence on it. Despite the long journey that precedes it, there are still key elements to focus on in order to promote a pure strike at the ball in what should be a straight shot. Hands should be ahead of the ball at impact. Your spine forward bend should closely match the one set at address still. Your eyes should be trained on the ball and your hips and hands should be facing the target, or well on their way. An impact made with an iron should be made on a downward motion while one made with a wood should be made after the club has reached the lowest point of the swing arc, as the clubhead is rising. Go to Impact Swing Tips The release and extension sequence of the golf swing occurs after impact with the ball. It corresponds to the phase that precedes the final golf position, i.e., the follow through. The term extension comes from the fact that both of your arms should be fully extended during the release.

From reading this article, you will hopefully get a good understanding of how a golf club can be swung in a repeatable and powerful motion.

However, this article is for informational purposes, and we highly recommend lessons with a PGA teaching professional, they are very beneficial to learning the game of golf. If you start with good fundamentals and principles, this will help set you in the longer term to become a better golf player.

Grip the club creating connection!

It is essential you grip your golf club properly, as this will affect the impact on the golf ball’s trajectory and flight. When it comes to golf swing basics, the correct grip is extremely important to help you square the club head to the golf ball. Choosing the right grip can stop elbow pain developing.

Grip size

Generally golf clubs are fitted with a standard size grip. Getting fitted for your clubs really helps, as there are many sizes and thicknesses of grip available to make it more comfortable. In most cases the standard grips are suitable for golfers with smaller hands. Golfers who have larger hands often require midsize grips or more layers of tape under the grip.

The golf grip involves two parts.

The upper hand, or lead hand, is placed higher at the end of the grip handle, then your lower hand or trailing hand is placed under to add to the grip.

Many golfers have an overlapping grip either using an interlock or Vardon grip. This will help the hands work together in the swing.

There are three different strengths of golf grip

1) The neutral grip

To set up a neutral grip start by positioning your club face square to the ball at address aiming at your target.

Position your lead hand on the grip and ensure that only two knuckles of the lead hand are visible, being the index finger and middle finger. Then position your trail hand below your lead hand and ensure that only the knuckles of the index finger and the middle finger of the trail hand are visible.

2) The strong grip

Setting up with a stronger grip promotes a closed club face through impact, this will result in a draw or hook of your golf ball, due to your hands turning over more through impact.

By placing your leading hand on the grip, allowing the ring finger to become visible together with the two knuckles of the trail hand. This will give you a stronger grip at address.

3) The weak grip

Setting up for a weak grip is the opposite of a strong grip, where the lead hand leans more toward the non-dominant side. This results in only the index knuckle being visible at address, promoting an open club face at impact producing a fade or slice ball trajectory.

Golf Swing Planes

What is golf swing plane?

The golf swing plane is the angle and path created by your club as it travels in to your back swing from the address position, reaching the top of your backswing and then back through the ball to your follow through position.

There are two types of swing, the One-Plane and Two-Plane swing:

One-plane

The one plane golf swing can be a preferred choice, as this technique is simple and requires less timing to be accurate. It allows for a more shallow swing plane around the body, this enables better players who are looking to draw the ball more in their swing. The plane at the address remains the same throughout the entire swing, making the swing easier to repeat.

The one plane swing is good for players that have good upper body flexibility and strong recoil. Many top modern golf professionals have changed towards one plane swings, as they have specific golf strength and flexibility, allowing this type of motion.

Two-plane

The two-plane swing is more complicated and steeper than the one-plane swing. The backswing is much more upright, and then by dropping your hands during the transition phase, the downswing becomes a much flatter plane. This type of swing is also characterised by the lead arm swinging upwards to be in a more upright position, than the shoulders at the top of the swing.

The two-plane swing helps promote an increase in swing speed and distance. To swing a golf club like this is more suited to players that may not be as flexible, but they have excellent timing and rhythm in their golf swing.

Refine the best golf posture

Posture is a key fundamental and one of the golf swing basics of creating a solid golf swing. Getting yourself into optimal golf posture is crucial in your setup, when you are addressing the golf ball. Your swing relies on a consistent and solid foundation being retained; this helps you deliver a solid strike of the golf ball.

It is really important to develop your golf posture by adopting an athletic position and aligning your body parallel to the target line for straighter and more accurate golf shots. Let your body hinge forward at your hips and keep knees slightly bent, arms naturally fall down to your sides, before bringing in to grip your club in a relaxed manner and position. Your final golf posture should feel comfortable, relaxed and prepared for movement to swing a golf club.

Good body alignment

In golf, you need to be precise where you are aiming and to be accurate. It is really important to set yourself, so you know where you want the ball to start before you can hit many good golf shots.

When addressing the ball, it is really important to establish your target line, making sure your left foot and right foot are aligned towards your target. As your upper body tilts forward, it is important to keep your knees bent, let your shoulders match your foot line aiming at the target line.

Always check your alignment as you set up. Try to think of an imaginary line passing from your back shoulder to front shoulder, and another line from left foot to right foot, pointing directly at your target. This is referred to as keeping your alignment “square to target”.

An easy way to check your alignment at the golf course, get into your golf stance and place a golf club on the practice ground teeing area, ensuring it runs along the tips of your toes. Then take a step back from the golf club and look at the direction the club shaft is pointing. Ideally it should be pointed either directly at your target or slightly left.

Ball position

The position of your golf ball actually changes depending on which club you are using. The reason we move this position to swing a golf club is that we want to achieve optimal impact position and launch conditions. Ball position is changed to swing a golf club to achieve the best ball flight for the club in hand.

The longer the club, the further forward the ball position. For example, when using your driver the ball should be farthest forward, just inside your left heel. As you come down the clubs, moving progressively the ball farther back until you get to your wedges, here the ball should sit squarely in the middle of your stance.

What does your golf swing involve?

Backswing

The golf backswing is a really important part of the swing, how you raise the golf club away from the target towards your back from address position really dictates what happens to the rest of your swing. A poor backswing and takeaway can and will often result in a poorly executed full swing.

Try to start your swing by taking the hands in a straight line back, while holding them near to your back leg and keeping your left arm in a straight line while you do this. Simultaneously let your whole body rotate as you take the club away. As the club face pivots away towards the back swing try to keep width in your arms.

During the backswing, your trunk will rotate more than your pelvis rotation, this helps transfer the weight from your front foot to your back foot. It is really important to maintain good balance as you rotate onto your trail side. If you can develop good shoulder turn this will really help you get into the correct sequencing developing a strong swing.

When moving your arms move towards the top of your swing, your wrist will start to cock and the club should virtually be at right angles to your front arm, while the butt of the club is aiming marginally outside the golf ball. Continue turning, whilst pushing your hands and arms back until the club faces down the target line behind your head.

Your lead shoulder should turn under your chin and behind the ball to reach the top of the backswing. Keep your torso bent as you turn, maintaining posture and balance whilst keeping your back leg bent. When reaching the top of your backswing, your body should be completely coiled and geared up for the downswing.

Transition of the swing

Once you have completed your backswing, there is often a slight delay before commencing the downswing. Rushing your downswing is almost certain to prevent good contact and sequencing in your swing. Take your time at the top of your backswing, allows you to harmonise all the moving parts in your swing, creating an effortless rhythm for solid ball contact. Try to learn good timing by transitioning with rhythm at the top position of your swing, before you start your downswing.

Downswing and impact position

Following a smooth take away into your backswing and a well timed transition at the top, the downswing should likewise be smooth in rhythm to maintain control of all the parts engaged in the swing and to help sequencing in the downswing. The downswing should start slowly and build speed progressively as the club approaches the impact position, until you reach maximum club head speed at impact.

Initiate your downswing by loading into your leg leg and sense that your right shoulder and right hip drive in sequence towards the ball direction and that your arms are falling downwards as your hips clear to your left side for peak speed at impact.

The synchronised movement of the hip and shoulders, involves the hips firing faster and staying ahead of the shoulders, allowing the lower body to lead the swing. By starting the swing this way and using your hips will help generate power through your hip drive first and foremost. Ensure you turn in to your left side instead of sliding ahead too much, this helps avoid reverse pivoting and gets you moving towards the target, promoting the creation of maximum speed and power in your swing.

If you start the downswing by sliding your hips forward too soon, this encourages your body to lean backwards, creating a reverse pivot that slows your swing down and prevents you from covering the golf properly achieving the highest swing speed you can.

Finish and follow through

Following through and finishing balanced towards your target is a key golf swing fundamental. Many golfers believe that once they create contact with the ball and the club face, their swing is complete. Although good contact is important, stopping your swing at that point will result in the deceleration of the head at the exact moment, when in fact acceleration should be at its highest. This continues right through to a balanced finish extending to the target. If you do not complete the follow through this severely affects your ball trajectory and your balance. In the finish position, your body should have rotated right through to have your belt buckle pointing towards the target, your weight balanced on your lead foot with the trailing foot balanced on it’s big toe, the club should be positioned high behind your head and body stable.

You should be able to maintain your finish position, as if you are posing for photos as you watch the ball flying towards your target. That is the correct way to swing a golf club, watching many amateur players they struggle to extend through and balance in their finish position.

How to swing a golf club – the magical tip!

Every golfer has their own unique swing, and you should not focus too much on what your swing looks like, but more on feel and performance. Golfers tend to offer golf tips to each other, but each of us has different physiology and skill sets, thus what works for you may not work for someone else. Your swing may not be textbook, but you must learn what works best for you and your body. Taking lessons with a PGA professional is very helpful, as they will understand cues and drills to get the best out of your individual golf swings.

Keep your head down

A simple swing thought is to keep looking down at the back of the ball, even after making contact stay down for a short period. Let your head come up naturally at the moment you can no longer stay down during the follow through. In contrast, lifting your head too early just before impact and taking your eye off the ball, can result in poor contact with ball. This is often one of the first swing instructions given to many beginner golfers. Often beginners are very anxious to see where the ball will go after they hit it, which often leads to them lifting their heads and taking their eyes off the ball at impact.

It is a natural predisposition of many golfers to look at where their ball is going instead of pausing to see contact made between the club face and the golf ball.

When you swing hard, fast and powerfully, this will tend to force your head up due to the impetus generated. When this happens this can cause for you to lift your club head. This movement alters your swing path and frequently leads to you topping or mishitting the ball.

Weight transfer

In your swing, as you turn backwards you naturally transfer your body weight from the centre to your back foot loading into your leg with a soft right knee. As you initiate your downswing, your weight is driven back across to your left side towards the intended target. Maintain the flex in your knees as you downswing to aid the weight transfer to the front foot. Then drive the hips up and around, as left knee straightens, allowing you to stack onto the left leg shifting forward in the direction of the target.

To help get correct weight transfer in your swing, avoid driving your weight too early or beginning the down swing movement leading with your hands too quickly. By doing this, can result in altered path and angle of the club head, which can influence the speed and direction of the golf shot.

Some tips to build a great golf swing

Let us look at some simple tips that you can use to build a better golf swing and allow you to become more competitive. Each of these golf swing tips are aimed to help raise your game. It is recommended that you practice each of the golf tips individually, stick with one change until it feels natural, and you master it.

Tip #1: Control direction with your lead hand

With time you can learn to control the club face and direction with the back of your lead hand. For example, in your golf swing, if you point the back of your lead hand to the left of your target. By doing this closes the club face at impact and promotes a draw ball flight. To fade the ball, hit your shots where you point the back of your lead hand to the right of the target, opening the face at impact. Many professional golfers develop this skill and can point the back of their lead hand for as long as possible after impact to direct the ball to its target and improving their accuracy.

Tip #2: Improve golf grip for straighter shots

How you take grip of the golf club will affect how you swing the club, and you can really neutral pattern your swing with an improved grip. Having a good neutral grip on the club, will make your shots fly straighter at your target. It is important to grip the club softly, but firmly. It helps at set up to wiggle the club a bit to release the tension in your forearm and wrists. It is a good idea to practice the grip to discover what gives you the best feel to hit solid golf shots.

Tip #3: Swing smoothly for better tempo

Most beginner golfers swing too hard and quickly, and this quick swing can throw you off balance and affect your accuracy. To help slow a fast swing, you can count throughout the swing process slowing your swing. May be count one when you start the swing, two when you reach the top of your backswing, then three at the point of impact, and four once you conclude with a balanced finish.

Tip #4: Know your target

Many golfers think too much about the golf swing, they neglect to set up properly aiming correctly at the target. The really important part of the golf swing is when you hit the ball and as the club releases to where you want the ball to go. Pick a spot a couple of steps in front of you to align yourself to the target. It helps to be focused on a small target before taking your swing, as this improves your dispersion. It is important not to get too caught up in your swing and focus on your target instead and the type of shot you want to hit.

Obviously, your golf swing does matter, but do not analyse this on the golf course, as it will get you nowhere if you do not focus on your aim.

Tip #5: Adjust your stance for a better strike

Just by setting up properly helps many golfers hit the ball with the middle of the golf club head. Poor execution often arises because of a poor setup, standing in the correct position with the ball in the correct position really helps for an efficient golf swing. Ensure you aim for a golf posture that puts your body in a balanced and athletic position. Your body then can rotate freely around your centre of axis, and you can maintain this throughout the swing.

What else can you do to improve your golf swing?

There are many physical and technical aspects to swinging a golf club, and your mind plays an equally significant role. It is important to keep a clear and strong mindset during your swing sequence, really learn to develop a clear picture of the shot you need to hit. Creating consistency in your swing involves good preparation and commitment. It is vital to build a good routine to help build a fluid swing maintaining the same tempo and balance from the takeaway to the finish. There is a time to swing hard and fast but try to stay away from using aggressive force to generate speed. Try to start with an effortless swing and speed it up as you learn good patterns and timing. It is important not to tense up when swinging your golf club.

Golf is an atypical sport, where hand-eye coordination plays a huge role over athletic prowess. The golf ball is static when you strike it and that point makes performing the golf club swing with control more important than swinging with speed like in baseball. Timing and good sequencing can create enough power in golf. Get your body golf fit, most amateurs are not supple enough to get into the correct positions for the golf swing. Most of us stay stuck in flexion for the most part at work or commuting. Opening your hips and chest will really help you to extend through the ball and improve your golf swing.

In summary

The golf swing is a very complex process involving many moving parts, which combine to connect the club head and golf ball with perfect timing. Unless you understand the correct sequencing, many will struggle to execute this extraordinarily complex process without knowing the complete process of an effective golf swing. Get some coaching or watch some instructional videos to help you know and understand the golf swing mechanics, this will enable you to help unlearn any golf swing errors and improve your golf game, so that you know how to swing a golf club properly.

It does seem like a lot to think about and learn when it comes to golf, but take it one step at a time and read through this article again from time to time to see where you may be able to improve.

As you come down the clubs, moving progressively the ball farther back until you get to your wedges, here the ball should sit squarely in the middle of your stance. What does your golf swing involve? Backswing The golf backswing is a really important part of the swing, how you raise the golf club away from the target towards your back from address position really dictates what happens to the rest of your swing. A poor backswing and takeaway can and will often result in a poorly executed full swing. Try to start your swing by taking the hands in a straight line back, while holding them near to your back leg and keeping your left arm in a straight line while you do this. Simultaneously let your whole body rotate as you take the club away. As the club face pivots away towards the back swing try to keep width in your arms. During the backswing, your trunk will rotate more than your pelvis rotation, this helps transfer the weight from your front foot to your back foot. It is really important to maintain good balance as you rotate onto your trail side. If you can develop good shoulder turn this will really help you get into the correct sequencing developing a strong swing. When moving your arms move towards the top of your swing, your wrist will start to cock and the club should virtually be at right angles to your front arm, while the butt of the club is aiming marginally outside the golf ball. Continue turning, whilst pushing your hands and arms back until the club faces down the target line behind your head. Your lead shoulder should turn under your chin and behind the ball to reach the top of the backswing. Keep your torso bent as you turn, maintaining posture and balance whilst keeping your back leg bent. When reaching the top of your backswing, your body should be completely coiled and geared up for the downswing. Transition of the swing Once you have completed your backswing, there is often a slight delay before commencing the downswing. Rushing your downswing is almost certain to prevent good contact and sequencing in your swing. Take your time at the top of your backswing, allows you to harmonise all the moving parts in your swing, creating an effortless rhythm for solid ball contact. Try to learn good timing by transitioning with rhythm at the top position of your swing, before you start your downswing. Downswing and impact position Following a smooth take away into your backswing and a well timed transition at the top, the downswing should likewise be smooth in rhythm to maintain control of all the parts engaged in the swing and to help sequencing in the downswing. The downswing should start slowly and build speed progressively as the club approaches the impact position, until you reach maximum club head speed at impact. Initiate your downswing by loading into your leg leg and sense that your right shoulder and right hip drive in sequence towards the ball direction and that your arms are falling downwards as your hips clear to your left side for peak speed at impact. The synchronised movement of the hip and shoulders, involves the hips firing faster and staying ahead of the shoulders, allowing the lower body to lead the swing. By starting the swing this way and using your hips will help generate power through your hip drive first and foremost. Ensure you turn in to your left side instead of sliding ahead too much, this helps avoid reverse pivoting and gets you moving towards the target, promoting the creation of maximum speed and power in your swing. If you start the downswing by sliding your hips forward too soon, this encourages your body to lean backwards, creating a reverse pivot that slows your swing down and prevents you from covering the golf properly achieving the highest swing speed you can. Finish and follow through Following through and finishing balanced towards your target is a key golf swing fundamental. Many golfers believe that once they create contact with the ball and the club face, their swing is complete. Although good contact is important, stopping your swing at that point will result in the deceleration of the head at the exact moment, when in fact acceleration should be at its highest. This continues right through to a balanced finish extending to the target. If you do not complete the follow through this severely affects your ball trajectory and your balance. In the finish position, your body should have rotated right through to have your belt buckle pointing towards the target, your weight balanced on your lead foot with the trailing foot balanced on its big toe, the club should be positioned high behind your head and body stable. You should be able to maintain your finish position, as if you are posing for photos as you watch the ball flying towards your target. That is the correct way to swing a golf club, watching many amateur players they struggle to extend through and balance in their finish position. How to swing a golf club  the magical tip! Every golfer has their own unique swing, and you should not focus too much on what your swing looks like, but more on feel and performance. Golfers tend to offer golf tips to each other, but each of us has different physiology and skill sets, thus what works for you may not work for someone else. Your swing may not be textbook, but you must learn what works best for you and your body. Taking lessons with a PGA professional is very helpful, as they will understand cues and drills to get the best out of your individual golf swings. Keep your head down A simple swing thought is to keep looking down at the back of the ball, even after making contact stay down for a short period. Let your head come up naturally at the moment you can no longer stay down during the follow through. In contrast, lifting your head too early just before impact and taking your eye off the ball, can result in poor contact with ball. This is often one of the first swing instructions given to many beginner golfers. Often beginners are very anxious to see where the ball will go after they hit it, which often leads to them lifting their heads and taking their eyes off the ball at impact. It is a natural predisposition of many golfers to look at where their ball is going instead of pausing to see contact made between the club face and the golf ball. When you swing hard, fast and powerfully, this will tend to force your head up due to the impetus generated. When this happens this can cause for you to lift your club head. This movement alters your swing path and frequently leads to you topping or mishitting the ball. Weight transfer In your swing, as you turn backwards you naturally transfer your body weight from the centre to your back foot loading into your leg with a soft right knee. As you initiate your downswing, your weight is driven back across to your left side towards the intended target. Maintain the flex in your knees as you downswing to aid the weight transfer to the front foot. Then drive the hips up and around, as left knee straightens, allowing you to stack onto the left leg shifting forward in the direction of the target. To help get correct weight transfer in your swing, avoid driving your weight too early or beginning the down swing movement leading with your hands too quickly. By doing this, can result in altered path and angle of the club head, which can influence the speed and direction of the golf shot. Some tips to build a great golf swing Let us look at some simple tips that you can use to build a better golf swing and allow you to become more competitive. Each of these golf swing tips are aimed to help raise your game. It is recommended that you practice each of the golf tips individually, stick with one change until it feels natural, and you master it. Tip 1 Control direction with your lead hand With time you can learn to control the club face and direction with the back of your lead hand. For example, in your golf swing, if you point the back of your lead hand to the left of your target. By doing this closes the club face at impact and promotes a draw ball flight. To fade the ball, hit your shots where you point the back of your lead hand to the right of the target, opening the face at impact. Many professional golfers develop this skill and can point the back of their lead hand for as long as possible after impact to direct the ball to its target and improving their accuracy. Tip 2 Improve golf grip for straighter shots How you take grip of the golf club will affect how you swing the club, and you can really neutral pattern your swing with an improved grip. Having a good neutral grip on the club, will make your shots fly straighter at your target. It is important to grip the club softly, but firmly. It helps at set up to wiggle the club a bit to release the tension in your forearm and wrists. It is a good idea to practice the grip to discover what gives you the best feel to hit solid golf shots. Tip 3 Swing smoothly for better tempo Most beginner golfers swing too hard and quickly, and this quick swing can throw you off balance and affect your accuracy. To help slow a fast swing, you can count throughout the swing process slowing your swing. May be count one when you start the swing, two when you reach the top of your backswing, then three at the point of impact, and four once you conclude with a balanced finish. Tip 4 Know your target Many golfers think too much about the golf swing, they neglect to set up properly aiming correctly at the target. The really important part of the golf swing is when you hit the ball and as the club releases to where you want the ball to go. Pick a spot a couple of steps in front of you to align yourself to the target. It helps to be focused on a small target before taking your swing, as this improves your dispersion. It is important not to get too caught up in your swing and focus on your target instead and the type of shot you want to hit. Obviously, your golf swing does matter, but do not analyse this on the golf course, as it will get you nowhere if you do not focus on your aim. Tip 5 Adjust your stance for a better strike Just by setting up properly helps many golfers hit the ball with the middle of the golf club head. Poor execution often arises because of a poor setup, standing in the correct position with the ball in the correct position really helps for an efficient golf swing. Ensure you aim for a golf posture that puts your body in a balanced and athletic position. Your body then can rotate freely around your centre of axis, and you can maintain this throughout the swing. What else can you do to improve your golf swing? There are many physical and technical aspects to swinging a golf club, and your mind plays an equally significant role. It is important to keep a clear and strong mindset during your swing sequence, really learn to develop a clear picture of the shot you need to hit. Creating consistency in your swing involves good preparation and commitment. It is vital to build a good routine to help build a fluid swing maintaining the same tempo and balance from the takeaway to the finish. There is a time to swing hard and fast but try to stay away from using aggressive force to generate speed. Try to start with an effortless swing and speed it up as you learn good patterns and timing. It is important not to tense up when swinging your golf club. Golf is an atypical sport, where hand-eye coordination plays a huge role over athletic prowess. The golf ball is static when you strike it and that point makes performing the golf club swing with control more important than swinging with speed like in baseball. Timing and good sequencing can create enough power in golf. Get your body golf fit, most amateurs are not supple enough to get into the correct positions for the golf swing. Most of us stay stuck in flexion for the most part at work or commuting. Opening your hips and chest will really help you to extend through the ball and improve your golf swing. In summary The golf swing is a very complex process involving many moving parts, which combine to connect the club head and golf ball with perfect timing. Unless you understand the correct sequencing, many will struggle to execute this extraordinarily complex process without knowing the complete process of an effective golf swing. Get some coaching or watch some instructional videos to help you know and understand the golf swing mechanics, this will enable you to help unlearn any golf swing errors and improve your golf game, so that you know how to swing a golf club properly.

From reading this article, you will hopefully get a good understanding of how a golf club can be swung in a repeatable and powerful motion. However, this article is for informational purposes, and we highly recommend lessons with a PGA teaching professional, they are very beneficial to learning the game of golf. If you start with good fundamentals and principles, this will help set you in the longer term to become a better golf player. Grip the club creating connection! It is essential you grip your golf club properly, as this will affect the impact on the golf balls trajectory and flight. When it comes to golf swing basics, the correct grip is extremely important to help you square the club head to the golf ball. Choosing the right grip can stop elbow pain developing. Grip size Generally golf clubs are fitted with a standard size grip. Getting fitted for your clubs really helps, as there are many sizes and thicknesses of grip available to make it more comfortable. In most cases the standard grips are suitable for golfers with smaller hands. Golfers who have larger hands often require midsize grips or more layers of tape under the grip. The golf grip involves two parts. The upper hand, or lead hand, is placed higher at the end of the grip handle, then your lower hand or trailing hand is placed under to add to the grip. Many golfers have an overlapping grip either using an interlock or Vardon grip. This will help the hands work together in the swing. There are three different strengths of golf grip 1 The neutral grip To set up a neutral grip start by positioning your club face square to the ball at address aiming at your target. Position your lead hand on the grip and ensure that only two knuckles of the lead hand are visible, being the index finger and middle finger. Then position your trail hand below your lead hand and ensure that only the knuckles of the index finger and the middle finger of the trail hand are visible. 2 The strong grip Setting up with a stronger grip promotes a closed club face through impact, this will result in a draw or hook of your golf ball, due to your hands turning over more through impact. By placing your leading hand on the grip, allowing the ring finger to become visible together with the two knuckles of the trail hand. This will give you a stronger grip at address. 3 The weak grip Setting up for a weak grip is the opposite of a strong grip, where the lead hand leans more toward the non-dominant side. This results in only the index knuckle being visible at address, promoting an open club face at impact producing a fade or slice ball trajectory. Golf Swing Planes What is golf swing plane? The golf swing plane is the angle and path created by your club as it travels in to your back swing from the address position, reaching the top of your backswing and then back through the ball to your follow through position. There are two types of swing, the One-Plane and Two-Plane swing One-plane The one plane golf swing can be a preferred choice, as this technique is simple and requires less timing to be accurate. It allows for a more shallow swing plane around the body, this enables better players who are looking to draw the ball more in their swing. The plane at the address remains the same throughout the entire swing, making the swing easier to repeat. The one plane swing is good for players that have good upper body flexibility and strong recoil. Many top modern golf professionals have changed towards one plane swings, as they have specific golf strength and flexibility, allowing this type of motion. Two-plane The two-plane swing is more complicated and steeper than the one-plane swing. The backswing is much more upright, and then by dropping your hands during the transition phase, the downswing becomes a much flatter plane. This type of swing is also characterised by the lead arm swinging upwards to be in a more upright position, than the shoulders at the top of the swing. The two-plane swing helps promote an increase in swing speed and distance. To swing a golf club like this is more suited to players that may not be as flexible, but they have excellent timing and rhythm in their golf swing. Refine the best golf posture Posture is a key fundamental and one of the golf swing basics of creating a solid golf swing. Getting yourself into optimal golf posture is crucial in your setup, when you are addressing the golf ball. Your swing relies on a consistent and solid foundation being retained this helps you deliver a solid strike of the golf ball. It is really important to develop your golf posture by adopting an athletic position and aligning your body parallel to the target line for straighter and more accurate golf shots. Let your body hinge forward at your hips and keep knees slightly bent, arms naturally fall down to your sides, before bringing in to grip your club in a relaxed manner and position. Your final golf posture should feel comfortable, relaxed and prepared for movement to swing a golf club. Good body alignment In golf, you need to be precise where you are aiming and to be accurate. It is really important to set yourself, so you know where you want the ball to start before you can hit many good golf shots. When addressing the ball, it is really important to establish your target line, making sure your left foot and right foot are aligned towards your target. As your upper body tilts forward, it is important to keep your knees bent, let your shoulders match your foot line', 'setup, when you are addressing the golf ball.

As your upper body tilts forward, it is important to keep your knees bent, let your shoulders match your foot line aiming at the target line. Always check your alignment as you set up. Try to think of an imaginary line passing from your back shoulder to front shoulder, and another line from left foot to right foot, pointing directly at your target. This is referred to as keeping your alignment square to target. An easy way to check your alignment at the golf course, get into your golf stance and place a golf club on the practice ground teeing area, ensuring it runs along the tips of your toes. Then take a step back from the golf club and look at the direction the club shaft is pointing. Ideally it should be pointed either directly at your target or slightly left. Ball position The position of your golf ball actually changes depending on which club you are using. The reason we move this position to swing a golf club is that we want to achieve optimal impact position and launch conditions. Ball position is changed to swing a golf club to achieve the best ball flight for the club in hand. The longer the club, the further forward the ball position.

Many golfers are in search of the perfect golf swing. As a golf coach and biomechanist, I’m sad to inform you that one perfect golf swing does not exist. However, the science suggests great golfers’ swings do have many things in common.

In this article we’ll cover a quick overview of what we mean when we say a perfect golf swing, we’ll then dive into swing mechanics that great golfers exhibit. To summarise we’ll then discuss what this means for your golf game. Grab a coffee and have a read, or use the table of contents below to jump to your preferred section.

This article is a little geeky so if you want a simpler guide check out this guide on how to swing a golf club or this piece for some great golf swing tips.

The perfect golf swing maximises performance not positions

Below we have four golfers who have made it to men’s world #1 – it is quite evident their golf swings all look different. What they have in common is what their golf swings provide. Their golf swings all deliver the following qualities:

High levels of shot accuracy.

High levels of repeatability in shot outcome.

Good ability to generate shot distance.

Adaptability of ball flight trajectory.

Keep them free from injury (most of the time).

Positions are not what all great golf swings have in common.

With this in mind we know our quest for the perfect golf swing is an action that delivers performance rather than textbook positions. This also hints at something we’ll discuss later on – forces are what really count in the golf swing.

Below we’ll run through the science of great golf swing mechanics phase by phase:

Backswing mechanics

Lower body swing mechanics

Despite modern-day players showing less lateral movement during their backswing, they still transfer most of their weight onto their back foot (65 – 85%). Like any throwing action this allows the player to push off through their back foot during the downswing and begin to effectively unwind their body towards the target.

What has changed in modern times is how the legs and pelvis move to create this loading during the backswing.

This video has been embedded from Michael John Field’s Youtube Channel go check it out and subscribe for more great videos.

Historically, the back knee would extend (straighten) and the front knee flexed. Meaning, when you look face-on at a golfer, the right hip would appear higher than the left, and the left leg appeared to fold inwards. This move allowed the pelvis to rotate more freely away from the target, creating a long backswing, but without effectively storing potential energy.

Modern golf swing mechanics often prefer players to maintain flex in their right knee, and have far less displacement in the position of their left leg from setup. This creates a picture from face on where the left and right hips appear more level. There is also a greater focus on players maintaining their posture (left and right hip flexion) as they reach the top of their swing – the rationale for these positions is to maximise our use of the stretch-shortening cycle.

The stretch-shortening cycle underpins many athletic movements, including the golf swing. Essentially, if we stretch a muscle group before we maximally contract it, we can generate more force. In some cases up to 60% more force. We used to think this was purely due to the stored mechanical energy, like stretching an elastic band, but nowadays we know the process is far more complicated (lots or neural stuff).

If we retain our right knee flexion throughout our backswing, we keep the quadriceps in a lengthened state, our hamstrings and gluteals are also lengthened when we maintain hip flexion (maintaining posture). All of the muscle groups above are further lengthened as the pelvis rotates away from the target during the backswing.

These swing mechanics are shown brilliantly above by Rory McIlroy. They have the effect of pre-loading large muscle groups in the lower body, ready to generate some serious speed in the downswing.

Individual differences in hip rotation

10 – 15 years ago there was a strong school of thought that the hips should be restricted from rotating during the backswing, in order to increase the separation between the pelvis and upper body. This concept has some merit, but can increase the risk of injury, and actually reduces the stretch-shortening benefits in the lower body detailed above.

Today, an increasing number of golf coaches are advising more hip rotation during the backswing, thankfully (‘getting deep into your right hip’ is the hot phrase I’ve heard used to describe this move). As your pelvis rotates posteriorly you should feel your weight shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot.

The optimal swing position to achieve this effect will vary for every golfer. Size, range of motion, strength, flexibility and tendon stiffness will all play a role. It is important for coaches and players to aim for an optimal mechanistic backswing for each player, not merely placing each player into the same position.

Key takeaway

Use your lower body to create a subtle, but powerful backswing position. Think less about textbook pictures and more about the dynamics of your golf swing.

Upper body swing mechanics

As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this.

As coaches, we often talk about shoulder rotation, but what we are actually looking at is the separation between the pelvis and thorax – known as thoracic rotation. This movement comes mainly from 12 vertebrae in the mid-section of your spine. The rotation is a result of many muscles around your mid-section contracting and relaxing in harmony.

A fundamental requirement for great upper body rotation is having a great posture at set-up. A hunched posture prevents your thoracic spine rotating, and adds extra load onto your lower back (lumbar spine), which isn’t designed to rotate in the same way. This is a common cause of injury in many golfers suffering from lower back pain.

A common misconception I would like to cover is how much thoracic rotation elite players exhibit during their backswing. Many amateurs believe elite players achieve 90 degrees of rotation, but when you model the golf swing in 3D and take the pelvis rotation into account elite players actually create, on average, 70 ± 20 degrees of rotation between their pelvis and thorax. Using some simple stats we can infer that 68% of elite players achieve somewhere between 50 to 90 degrees of thoracic rotation – far less than you might imagine. The rest of that rotation you see comes from internal and external hip rotation.

Key takeaways

Great posture at set-up is a must for great upper body swing mechanics. Elite players create 50 – 90 degrees of thoracic rotation, the rest comes from hip rotation. Try not to create more thoracic rotation than you are capable of, it isn’t necessary. Secondly, value how important hip rotation is in the modern golf swing. Look after and strengthen your hips – to do so you can check out this article for more ideas on improving strength and mobility in your hips.

Shoulders, arms and wrist mechanics

As your lower body and trunk are priming for force generation, your arms and wrists are predominantly determining what direction you launch that golf ball. As long as you strike the centre of the club face, accuracy is a product of your swing path and club face through impact.

During your backswing, both your shoulders and forearms rotate as your right elbow flexes, these actions keep the golf club arcing around your body. The more rotation from your shoulders and forearms, the flatter the shaft angle and more laid off the club will appear at the top of the backswing. The exact contribution of rotation from 1) shoulder rotation and 2) pronation/supination of the forearm is not clear – it is tricky to measure, even with 3D equipment. We can assume elite players show some variance in this area, as I’ll talk about later in this article.

Suggesting how the arm swing mechanics discussed above affect impact is not a straight forward debate. It will depend on pelvis, trunk mechanics and inertia forces of the arms and club as they reach the top of the backswing. But simply speaking, the more the arms rotate, and the more the club is laid off, the easier it is to create an in-to-out swing path. Less arm rotation creates a steeper shaft angle and an across the line position, which likely results in a more out-to-in swing path.

Wrist mechanics in the backswing

Wrist mechanics play two key roles during the backswing. Firstly, radial deviation creates a powerful lever system between the arms and the club, commonly called wrist hinge. Secondly, wrist flexion/extension manages the relationship between the club face angle and the arms. The third range of motion (pronation/supination) actually comes from the forearm and was discussed in the previous section. If you want to learn more about the wrist flexion/extension of elite players you can see a couple of the swing drills Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood use here.

Many beginner golfers struggle to create effective wrist mechanics, with the root cause commonly being a poor golf grip. If the golf club is gripped too close to the wrist joint in the left hand (near the centre of the palm), the left wrist becomes flexed at set-up to help square the clubface to the target. This position limits radial-ulna deviation (wrist hinge) resulting in golfers forcing the wrist to do something it isn’t primed to do. The first port of call in resolving poor wrist mechanics is to master your golf grip.

As the image below shows, elite golfers also show great variance in wrist mechanics during the backswing. The club face angle we see at the top of the backswing is a product of a player’s golf grip at set-up and their wrist flexion/extension at the top of the swing (we normally just look at the left wrist angle for simplicity).

The weaker the golf grip and the more extended the left wrist, the more open the club face will be relative to the body motion – generally leading to more fades and slices. The stronger the grip at set-up and the more flexed the left wrist, the more closed the club face will be (see DJ above), leading to more draws and hooks.

There is no ideal relationship or perfect club face angle in practice. A player’s optimal club face position needs to be married into a players release characteristics and desired ball flight.

Variability in golf swing mechanics

The arms and wrists contain many degrees of freedom, meaning we often see trial-to-trial variance that is much higher in the arms and wrists than in the trunk. We often think of variability as a bad thing in the golf swing, and yes, elite tour pros are far less variable than a 20 handicapper when it comes to swing-to-swing variance. But more recent research is starting to suggest elite players also show more functional variance in their golf swing mechanics.

From this perspective, elite players are more capable of returning the club head back to their ideal impact position from many different backswing positions. Less-elite players may show similar levels of variability in their backswing positions, but are not able to generate an ideal impact position from all of these permutations.

Downswing mechanics

Onto the downswing. As with the previous section, I’m not going to pretend I have the secrets to the perfect downswing. Instead, we’ll discuss the key movements and I’ll do my best to explain the science behind why these movements are important. We begin with the the ground reaction forces that cause the movements we see.

Ground reaction forces & golf swing mechanics

All successful striking actions (golf, tennis, baseball) start from the ground. If this seems counterintuitive, just go find your nearest ice rink and see how you fair hitting a driver. Ground reaction forces (GRF) are the forces that result from us pushing against the ground. We push against the ground and an equal, and opposing, force pushes back up into our body – this force initiates a lot of the movement we see in the golf swing.

Ground reaction forces are invisible without the use of a force plate (blue arrows in the images above), which makes wrapping your head around them quite tough. But trust me, they are always there and they are fundamental to great golf swing mechanics.

Research has consistently shown elite golfers generate higher levels of vertical GRF (pushing down), relative to their body weight, early-to-midway in their downswing. This makes good sense – as higher forces lead to greater acceleration of objects (F = m.a).

However, more recent research has looked into anterior-posterior (forward-back) and medial-lateral (sideways) forces. Elite players also generate greater anterior-posterior forces (one foot pushing forward, the other pushing back) during the start of their downswing. These forces are potentially more interesting, as they create torque in the lower body, and cause the pelvis to rotate towards the target. The bigger these forces, over a longer period of time (greater impulse), will lead to a greater rotational acceleration of the pelvis – Rory McIlroy’s pelvis rotation comes to mind.

Key takeaway

To create a powerful golf swing you need to be able to apply large forces into the ground – downwards, in order to create friction, but more importantly, pushing backwards with your front leg and forwards with your trail leg.

Conditioning will play an important role, but also consider players squatting motion at the start of your downswing. Optimal flexion in the hips and knees will differ from player to player, but each individual will have a sweet spot for applying larger ground reaction forces.

Body swing mechanics during the downswing

The most well known aspect of golf swing mechanics is the beautiful sequence we see Tiger portraying below:

A slight shift of weight Rotation of the pelvis Rotation of the thorax Rotation of the shoulders, forearms and ulnar deviation (release)

This is known as a kinematic sequence (sequence of movements) and it takes advantage of the summation of speed principle, where energy is generated in one segment, before being passed onto the next (pelvis > thorax > arms > club). The stretch-shortening cycle discussed in the backswing section is a key mechanism underpinning this sequence and how much additional energy can be passed on from one section to the next.

If this sequence can be well-timed, it results in each body segment generating a higher speed than the last, with peak club head velocity being achieved close to impact.

Figure showing the kinematic sequence of an elite player. The dotted lines represent swing events: Start of swing, 1/2 way back, top of backswing, 1/2 way down and impact. Minus numbers represent rotation away from the target, positive numbers represent rotational velocity towards the target.

Why amateurs struggle with this sequence

For many golfers this sequence is the holy grail, but most struggle – why they struggle is the million-dollar question. Recently, there has been a trend to fix physical limitations and there is no doubt that reduced mobility, stability and strength may inhibit golfers from achieving this sequence.

I’m not going to disagree, but here I would like golfers to realise that this sequence starts with ground reaction forces. Too many players try to mimic pelvis rotations of great players, when in fact great players show these movements as a consequence of the forces applied through their feet into the ground. Start with you feet and apply forces – the rest will follow.

Elite golf swing mechanics and sequencing

Although all professionals show similar patterns in their sequencing, there is no magical formula – just look at the videos of Rory, Brooks and Tiger in this article, they all vary; even to the naked eye. Elite players find a unique solution that helps them generate high club head speed whilst controlling the club head orientation through impact.

Nonetheless, there are some clear differences between elite and amateur players. Elite players show greater levels of rotational pelvis acceleration early on in the downswing, they then show a deceleration as they reach impact. This sounds counterintuitive but results in more energy being transferred to the thorax (see the image above). The second effect is that the pelvis is now rotating slower through impact (remember deceleration doesn’t mean zero velocity), potentially offering more control during this critical time.

Key takeaway

A great kinematic sequence starts from the ground, not the pelvis. Executed correctly, the pelvis reaches its peak angular velocity early on in the downswing, before slowing, not stopping, as it continues through impact.

Body swing mechanics moving towards impact

There is one more area of swing mechanics that falls outside current biomechanics research and falls more into the realm of modern coaching. I think it’s interesting to talk about, so I’ve discussed this briefly below.

In the 1960s and 1970s great players showed a lot of lateral movement as they moved into impact, caused by lateral joint actions at the ankle, hip and spine. These days we see a very different motion through impact, where players have far less lateral action and more rotation. Here we will discuss the lower body mechanics specific to this modern approach.

Again, credit to B Slingzz Youtube Channel where these screenshots captured from.

As discussed previously, modern golfers rotate their pelvis aggressively early on in the downswing, the pelvis quickly returns to its position at set-up and begins to rotate towards the target. It has passed on its energy, but if it stops rotating completely it will spark off a chain reaction that prevents many good ball strikers from becoming exceptional.

If the pelvis stops completely before impact, the thorax and arms will abruptly slow down too. The club head has been aggressively accelerating and cannot be slowed down. The consequence is the club head carries on and we see a breakdown between the angle of the club and left arm. This results in limited control of where the club face points through impact. We often see players hands flip over as they struggle with wild hooks.

To prevent this from happening the lower body creates some nifty adaptations. Near to impact, elite players continue to apply force to the ground through their back foot. Their right hip extends through impact, which forces the pelvis to keep turning. Many elite players also extend the left knee and hip slightly through the hitting zone, which gives the left side of the body more capacity to rotate and keeps the pelvis moving. This is demonstrated beautifully by Tiger Woods in the sequence above. The visual result is a solid left side, with the rest of the body rotating about the left leg.

Key takeaway

Great lower body action is the key to mastering club face control and accuracy through impact. The right side pushes, as the left side affords room for the pelvis to keep rotating. A great golf coach will make subtle changes to your posture, stance and weight distribution to help you find your solution.

Release and arms mechanics

How the arms and wrists move in an elite player is an under-researched topic in biomechanics and can still divide coaches. Some golfers incorrectly assume the arms do nothing during the downswing, they merely follow great body motion, but I would disagree. Personally, I feel great arm mechanics can elevate a player considerably once they have sound body mechanics in place.

A scroll back up to Tiger’s swing sequence will show you that early on in the downswing the left shoulder horizontally extends, bringing the club back in front of the chest. Many golfers including Tiger and Justin Rose talk about their arms falling down before they rotate their body through. Whereas amateur players often feel their body needs to do all the work whilst their arms stay passive.

This is the difference between feeling and doing in golf. The perfect golf swing is a blend of body rotation and arm swing. Most golfers have one aspect that lags behind the other and often requires extra attention.

If the downswing is started correctly you’ll get to a position similar to Rory and Tiger below. You can call this ‘the slot’ or pre-impact but it is a position where the club face and body is primed to deliver the club into impact.

Most golfers exhibit similar positions as we get closer to impact, but not identical. However, two different looking positions could produce almost identical forces at impact.

This is the position where all professional players look very similar, not identical. You need to be roughly in this position to deliver the club squarely and powerfully, but your perfect position will depend on your body mechanics, club face angle and the shot shape you wish to hit.

Let us look at what great players do from here, this is worth sharing.

The difference between amateurs and elite players swing mechanics

Once the club falls back down parallel to the ground we great players rotate to square the club face up at impact. The forces created by the summation of speed automatically cause the release of any wrist hinge into impact (ulnar deviation).

This area of swing mechanics is potentially the most misunderstood by amateur golfers. Amateur players often feel they have to use their wrists to square up the club face. However, when you look through all of the swings featured in this article, you’ll notice elite players show minimal changes in wrist flexion/extension. The club face is controlled through body rotation and pronation and supination in the forearms.

If there is anything close to a secret to the perfect golf swing, it is understanding this relationship between the arms and how they control the club face rotation during your golf swing.

Great golfers get into the position above then use the body and arms to rotate through impact – there is very little active hand action.

Key takeaway

The arms play an important role in your downswing mechanics. Becoming an exceptional ball striker requires getting to grips with how body rotation and pronation/supination control your club face during your downswing and through impact.

Building your perfect golf swing

So what does this mean for your golf game? In this article, I wanted to share the detail – the biomechanics behind the perfect golf swing. Hopefully, the understanding has helped you build an idea of what great golf swings look and feel like.

However, playing golf is different to the theory. Below is my summary of what I feel golfers should take away to become better players:

Your backswing should involve a turn and a shift of weight – what that looks like depends on your body type. Develop a golf grip, arm swing and left wrist position that sets the club face in a neutral position.

Start your downswing with a blend of body rotation and arm swing – what this will feel like depends on you and what is currently too active. Half way down you should have the club set in a position not identical, but closely resembling great players – pay particular attention to your club face angle at this point. 2 – 3º makes a large difference in accuracy.

From here the move through impact is mainly body rotation and some arm movement. Great players pre-set everything before impact and rotate through using their big muscles.

Finally, don’t loose sight of the end goal. Your aim is not to have a textbook looking swing, but rather to find a motion that hits the ball straight, is repeatable and keeps you free from injury.

In some cases up to 60 more force. We used to think this was purely due to the stored mechanical energy, like stretching an elastic band, but nowadays we know the process is far more complicated lots or neural stuff. If we retain our right knee flexion throughout our backswing, we keep the quadriceps in a lengthened state, our hamstrings and gluteals are also lengthened when we maintain hip flexion maintaining posture.

Today, an increasing number of golf coaches are advising more hip rotation during the backswing, thankfully getting deep into your right hip is the hot phrase Ive heard used to describe this move. As your pelvis rotates posteriorly you should feel your weight shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot. The optimal swing position to achieve this effect will vary for every golfer. Size, range of motion, strength, flexibility and tendon stiffness will all play a role. It is important for coaches and players to aim for an optimal mechanistic backswing for each player, not merely placing each player into the same position. Key takeaway Use your lower body to create a subtle, but powerful backswing position. Think less about textbook pictures and more about the dynamics of your golf swing. Upper body swing mechanics As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this.

Using some simple stats we can infer that 68 of elite players achieve somewhere between 50 to 90 degrees of thoracic rotation  far less than you might imagine. The rest of that rotation you see comes from internal and external hip rotation. Key takeaways Great posture at set-up is a must for great upper body swing mechanics. Elite players create 50  90 degrees of thoracic rotation, the rest comes from hip rotation. Try not to create more thoracic rotation than you are capable of, it isnt necessary.

Body swing mechanics during the downswing The most well known aspect of golf swing mechanics is the beautiful sequence we see Tiger portraying below A slight shift of weight Rotation of the pelvis Rotation of the thorax Rotation of the shoulders, forearms and ulnar deviation release This is known as a kinematic sequence sequence of movements and it takes advantage of the summation of speed principle, where energy is generated in one segment, before being passed onto the next pelvis  thorax  arms  club. The stretch-shortening cycle discussed in the backswing section is a key mechanism underpinning this sequence and how much additional energy can be passed on from one section to the next. If this sequence can be well-timed, it results in each body segment generating a higher speed than the last, with peak club head velocity being achieved close to impact. Figure showing the kinematic sequence of an elite player. The dotted lines represent swing events Start of swing, 12 way back, top of backswing, 12 way down and impact. Minus numbers represent rotation away from the target, positive numbers represent rotational velocity towards the target. Why amateurs struggle with this sequence For many golfers this sequence is the holy grail, but most struggle  why they struggle is the million-dollar question. Recently, there has been a trend to fix physical limitations and there is no doubt that reduced mobility, stability and strength may inhibit golfers from achieving this sequence. Im not going to disagree, but here I would like golfers to realise that this sequence starts with ground reaction forces. Too many players try to mimic pelvis rotations of great players, when in fact great players show these movements as a consequence of the forces applied through their feet into the ground. Start with you feet and apply forces  the rest will follow. Elite golf swing mechanics and sequencing Although all professionals show similar patterns in their sequencing, there is no magical formula  just look at the videos of Rory, Brooks and Tiger in this article, they all vary even to the naked eye. Elite players find a unique solution that helps them generate high club head speed whilst controlling the club head orientation through impact. Nonetheless, there are some clear differences between elite and amateur players. Elite players show greater levels of rotational pelvis acceleration early on in the downswing, they then show a deceleration as they reach impact. This sounds counterintuitive but results in more energy being transferred to the thorax see the image above. The second effect is that the pelvis is now rotating slower through impact remember deceleration doesnt mean zero velocity, potentially offering more control during this critical time. Key takeaway A great kinematic sequence starts from the ground, not the pelvis. Executed correctly, the pelvis reaches its peak angular velocity early on in the downswing, before slowing, not stopping, as it continues through impact. Body swing mechanics moving towards impact There is one more area of swing mechanics that falls outside current biomechanics research and falls more into the realm of modern coaching. I think its interesting to talk about, so Ive discussed this briefly below. In the 1960s and 1970s great players showed a lot of lateral movement as they moved into impact, caused by lateral joint actions at the ankle, hip and spine. These days we see a very different motion through impact, where players have far less lateral action and more rotation. Here we will discuss the lower body mechanics specific to this modern approach. Again, credit to B Slingzz Youtube Channel where these screenshots captured from. As discussed previously, modern golfers rotate their pelvis aggressively early on in the downswing, the pelvis quickly returns to its position at set-up and begins to rotate towards the target. It has passed on its energy, but if it stops rotating completely it will spark off a chain reaction that prevents many good ball strikers from becoming exceptional. If the pelvis stops completely before impact, the thorax and arms will abruptly slow down too. The club head has been aggressively accelerating and cannot be slowed down. The consequence is the club head carries on and we see a breakdown between the angle of the club and left arm. This results in limited control of where the club face points through impact. We often see players hands flip over as they struggle with wild hooks. To prevent this from happening the lower body creates some nifty adaptations. Near to impact, elite players continue to apply force to the ground through their back foot. Their right hip extends through impact, which forces the pelvis to keep turning. Many elite players also extend the left knee and hip slightly through the hitting zone, which gives the left side of the body more capacity to rotate and keeps the pelvis moving. This is demonstrated beautifully by Tiger Woods in the sequence above. The visual result is a solid left side, with the rest of the body rotating about the left leg. Key takeaway Great lower body action is the key to mastering club face control and accuracy through impact. The right side pushes, as the left side affords room for the pelvis to keep rotating. A great golf coach will make subtle changes to your posture, stance and weight distribution to help you find your solution. Release and arms mechanics How the arms and wrists move in an elite player is an under-researched topic in biomechanics and can still divide coaches. Some golfers incorrectly assume the arms do nothing during the downswing, they merely follow great body motion, but I would disagree. Personally, I feel great arm mechanics can elevate a player considerably once they have sound body mechanics in place. A scroll back up to Tigers swing sequence will show you that early on in the downswing the left shoulder horizontally extends, bringing the club back in front of the chest. Many golfers including Tiger and Justin Rose talk about their arms falling down before they rotate their body through. Whereas amateur players often feel their body needs to do all the work whilst their arms stay passive. This is the difference between feeling and doing in golf. The perfect golf swing is a blend of body rotation and arm swing. Most golfers have one aspect that lags behind the other and often requires extra attention. If the downswing is started correctly youll get to a position similar to Rory and Tiger below. You can call this the slot or pre-impact but it is a position where the club face and body is primed to deliver the club into impact. Most golfers exhibit similar positions as we get closer to impact, but not identical. However, two different looking positions could produce almost identical forces at impact. This is the position where all professional players look very similar, not identical. You need to be roughly in this position to deliver the club squarely and powerfully, but your perfect position will depend on your body mechanics, club face angle and the shot shape you wish to hit. Let us look at what great players do from here, this is worth sharing. The difference between amateurs and elite players swing mechanics Once the club falls back down parallel to the ground we great players rotate to square the club face up at impact. The forces created by the summation of speed automatically cause the release of any wrist hinge into impact ulnar deviation. This area of swing mechanics is potentially the most misunderstood by amateur golfers. Amateur players often feel they have to use their wrists to square up the club face. However, when you look through all of the swings featured in this article, youll notice elite players show minimal changes in wrist flexionextension. The club face is controlled through body rotation and pronation and supination in the forearms. If there is anything close to a secret to the perfect golf swing, it is understanding this relationship between the arms and how they control the club face rotation during your golf swing. Great golfers get into the position above then use the body and arms to rotate through impact  there is very little active hand action. Key takeaway The arms play an important role in your downswing mechanics. Becoming an exceptional ball striker requires getting to grips with how body rotation and pronationsupination control your club face during your downswing and through impact. Building your perfect golf swing So what does this mean for your golf game? In this article, I wanted to share the detail  the biomechanics behind the perfect golf swing. Hopefully, the understanding has helped you build an idea of what great golf swings look and feel like. However, playing golf is different to the theory. Below is my summary of what I feel golfers should take away to become better players Your backswing should involve a turn and a shift of weight  what that looks like depends on your body type. Develop a golf grip, arm swing and left wrist position that sets the club face in a neutral position. Start your downswing with a blend of body rotation and arm swing  what this will feel like depends on you and what is currently too active. Half way down you should have the club set in a position not identical, but closely resembling great players  pay particular attention to your club face angle at this point. 2  3º makes a large difference in accuracy. From here the move through impact is mainly body rotation and some arm movement. Great players pre-set everything before impact and rotate through using their big muscles. Finally, dont loose sight of the end goal. Your aim is not to have a textbook looking swing, but rather to find a motion that hits the ball straight, is repeatable and keeps you free from injury.

However, the science suggests great golfers swings do have many things in common. In this article well cover a quick overview of what we mean when we say a perfect golf swing, well then dive into swing mechanics that great golfers exhibit. To summarise well then discuss what this means for your golf game. Grab a coffee and have a read, or use the table of contents below to jump to your preferred section. This article is a little geeky so if you want a simpler guide check out this guide on how to swing a golf club or this piece for some great golf swing tips. The perfect golf swing maximises performance not positions Below we have four golfers who have made it to mens world 1 it is quite evident their golf swings all look different. What they have in common is what their golf swings provide. Their golf swings all deliver the following qualities High levels of shot accuracy. High levels of repeatability in shot outcome. Good ability to generate shot distance. Adaptability of ball flight trajectory. Keep them free from injury most of the time. Positions are not what all great golf swings have in common. With this in mind we know our quest for the perfect golf swing is an action that delivers performance rather than textbook positions. This also hints at something well discuss later on forces are what really count in the golf swing. Below well run through the science of great golf swing mechanics phase by phase Backswing mechanics Lower body swing mechanics Despite modern-day players showing less lateral movement during their backswing, they still transfer most of their weight onto their back foot 65 85. Like any throwing action this allows the player to push off through their back foot during the downswing and begin to effectively unwind their body towards the target. What has changed in modern times is how the legs and pelvis move to create this loading during the backswing. This video has been embedded from Michael John Fields Youtube Channel go check it out and subscribe for more great videos. Historically, the back knee would extend straighten and the front knee flexed. Meaning, when you look face-on at a golfer, the right hip would appear higher than the left, and the left leg appeared to fold inwards. This move allowed the pelvis to rotate more freely away from the target, creating a long backswing, but without effectively storing potential energy. Modern golf swing mechanics often prefer players to maintain flex in their right knee, and have far less displacement in the position of their left leg from setup. This creates a picture from face on where the left and right hips appear more level. There is also a greater focus on players maintaining their posture left and right hip flexion as they reach the top of their swing the rationale for these positions is to maximise our use of the stretch-shortening cycle. The stretch-shortening cycle underpins many athletic movements, including the golf swing. Essentially, if we stretch a muscle group before we maximally contract it, we can generate more force. In some cases up to 60 more force. We used to think this was purely due to the stored mechanical energy, like stretching an elastic band, but nowadays we know the process is far more complicated lots or neural stuff. If we retain our right knee flexion throughout our backswing, we keep the quadriceps in a lengthened state, our hamstrings and gluteals are also lengthened when we maintain hip flexion maintaining posture. All of the muscle groups above are further lengthened as the pelvis rotates away from the target during the backswing. These swing mechanics are shown brilliantly above by Rory McIlroy. They have the effect of pre-loading large muscle groups in the lower body, ready to generate some serious speed in the downswing. Individual differences in hip rotation 10 15 years ago there was a strong school of thought that the hips should be restricted from rotating during the backswing, in order to increase the separation between the pelvis and upper body. This concept has some merit, but can increase the risk of injury, and actually reduces the stretch-shortening benefits in the lower body detailed above. Today, an increasing number of golf coaches are advising more hip rotation during the backswing, thankfully getting deep into your right hip is the hot phrase Ive heard used to describe this move. As your pelvis rotates posteriorly you should feel your weight shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot. The optimal swing position to achieve this effect will vary for every golfer. Size, range of motion, strength, flexibility and tendon stiffness will all play a role. It is important for coaches and players to aim for an optimal mechanistic backswing for each player, not merely placing each player into the same position. Key takeaway Use your lower body to create a subtle, but powerful backswing position. Think less about textbook pictures and more about the dynamics of your golf swing. Upper body swing mechanics As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this. As coaches, we often talk about shoulder rotation, but what we are actually looking at is the separation between the pelvis and thorax known as thoracic rotation. This movement comes mainly from 12 vertebrae in the mid-section of your spine. The rotation is a result of many muscles around your mid-section contracting and relaxing in harmony. A fundamental requirement for great upper body rotation is having a great posture at set-up. A hunched posture', 'shifts slightly towards the heel of your back foot.

Upper body swing mechanics As the lower body does its thing to load and store power, the upper body makes a large rotation. The face-on video of Brooks Koepka below provides a great example of this. As coaches, we often talk about shoulder rotation, but what we are actually looking at is the separation between the pelvis and thorax known as thoracic rotation. This movement comes mainly from 12 vertebrae in the mid-section of your spine. The rotation is a result of many muscles around your mid-section contracting and relaxing in harmony. A fundamental requirement for great upper body rotation is having a great posture at set-up. A hunched posture prevents your thoracic spine rotating, and adds extra load onto your lower back lumbar spine, which isnt designed to rotate in the same way. This is a common cause of injury in many golfers suffering from lower back pain. A common misconception I would like to cover is how much thoracic rotation elite players exhibit during their backswing. Many amateurs believe elite players achieve 90 degrees of rotation, but when you model the golf swing in 3D and take the pelvis rotation into account elite players actually create, on average, 70 20 degrees of rotation between their pelvis and thorax. Using some simple stats we can infer that 68 of elite players achieve somewhere between 50 to 90 degrees of thoracic rotation far less than you might imagine. The rest of that rotation you see comes from internal and external hip rotation. Key takeaways Great posture at set-up is a must for great upper body swing mechanics. Elite players create 50 90 degrees of thoracic rotation, the rest comes from hip rotation. Try not to create more thoracic rotation than you are capable of, it isnt necessary. Secondly, value how important hip rotation is in the modern golf swing. Look after and strengthen your hips to do so you can check out this article for more ideas on improving strength and mobility in your hips. Shoulders, arms and wrist mechanics As your lower body and trunk are priming for force generation, your arms and wrists are predominantly determining what direction you launch that golf ball. As long as you strike the centre of the club face, accuracy is a product of your swing path and club face through impact. During your backswing, both your shoulders and forearms rotate as your right elbow flexes, these actions keep the golf club arcing around your body. The more rotation from your shoulders and forearms, the flatter the shaft angle and more laid off the club will appear at the top of the backswing. The exact contribution of rotation from 1 shoulder rotation and 2 pronationsupination of the forearm is not clear it is tricky to measure, even with 3D equipment. We can assume elite players show some variance in this area, as Ill talk about later in this article. Suggesting how the arm swing mechanics discussed above affect impact is not a straight forward debate. It will depend on pelvis, trunk mechanics and inertia forces of the arms and club as they reach the top of the backswing. But simply speaking, the more the arms rotate, and the more the club is laid off, the easier it is to create an in-to-out swing path. Less arm rotation creates a steeper shaft angle and an across the line position, which likely results in a more out-to-in swing path. Wrist mechanics in the backswing Wrist mechanics play two key roles during the backswing. Firstly, radial deviation creates a powerful lever system between the arms and the club, commonly called wrist hinge. Secondly, wrist flexionextension manages the relationship between the club face angle and the arms. The third range of motion pronationsupination actually comes from the forearm and was discussed in the previous section. If you want to learn more about the wrist flexionextension of elite players you can see a couple of the swing drills Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood use here. Many beginner golfers struggle to create effective wrist mechanics, with the root cause commonly being a poor golf grip. If the golf club is gripped too close to the wrist joint in the left hand near the centre of the palm, the left wrist becomes flexed at set-up to help square the clubface to the target. This position limits radial-ulna deviation wrist hinge resulting in golfers forcing the wrist to do something it isnt primed to do. The first port of call in resolving poor wrist mechanics is to master your golf grip. As the image below shows, elite golfers also show great variance in wrist mechanics during the backswing. The club face angle we see at the top of the backswing is a product of a players golf grip at set-up and their wrist flexionextension at the top of the swing we normally just look at the left wrist angle for simplicity. The weaker the golf grip and the more extended the left wrist, the more open the club face will be relative to the body motion generally leading to more fades and slices. The stronger the grip at set-up and the more flexed the left wrist, the more closed the club face will be see DJ above, leading to more draws and hooks. There is no ideal relationship or perfect club face angle in practice. A players optimal club face position needs to be married into a players release characteristics and', 'wrist becomes flexed at set-up to help square the clubface to the target.

There is no ideal relationship or perfect club face angle in practice. A players optimal club face position needs to be married into a players release characteristics and desired ball flight. Variability in golf swing mechanics The arms and wrists contain many degrees of freedom, meaning we often see trial-to-trial variance that is much higher in the arms and wrists than in the trunk. We often think of variability as a bad thing in the golf swing, and yes, elite tour pros are far less variable than a 20 handicapper when it comes to swing-to-swing variance. But more recent research is starting to suggest elite players also show more functional variance in their golf swing mechanics. From this perspective, elite players are more capable of returning the club head back to their ideal impact position from many different backswing positions. Less-elite players may show similar levels of variability in their backswing positions, but are not able to generate an ideal impact position from all of these permutations. Downswing mechanics Onto the downswing. As with the previous section, Im not going to pretend I have the secrets to the perfect downswing. Instead, well discuss the key movements and Ill do my best to explain the science behind why these movements are important. We begin with the the ground reaction forces that cause the movements we see. Ground reaction forces golf swing mechanics All successful striking actions golf, tennis, baseball start from the ground. If this seems counterintuitive, just go find your nearest ice rink and see how you fair hitting a driver. Ground reaction forces GRF are the forces that result from us pushing against the ground. We push against the ground and an equal, and opposing, force pushes back up into our body this force initiates a lot of the movement we see in the golf swing. Ground reaction forces are invisible without the use of a force plate blue arrows in the images above, which makes wrapping your head around them quite tough. But trust me, they are always there and they are fundamental to great golf swing mechanics. Research has consistently shown elite golfers generate higher levels of vertical GRF pushing down, relative to their body weight, early-to-midway in their downswing. This makes good sense as higher forces lead to greater acceleration of objects F m.a. However, more recent research has looked into anterior-posterior forward-back and medial-lateral sideways forces. Elite players also generate greater anterior-posterior forces one foot pushing forward, the other pushing back during the start of their downswing. These forces are potentially more interesting, as they create torque in the lower body, and cause the pelvis to rotate towards the target. The bigger these forces, over a longer period of time greater impulse, will lead to a greater rotational acceleration of the pelvis Rory McIlroys pelvis rotation comes to mind. Key takeaway To create a powerful golf swing you need to be able to apply large forces into the ground downwards, in order to create friction, but more importantly, pushing backwards with your front leg and forwards with your trail leg. Conditioning will play an important role, but also consider players squatting motion at the start of your downswing. Optimal flexion in the hips and knees will differ from player to player, but each individual will have a sweet spot for applying larger ground reaction forces. Body swing mechanics during the downswing The most well known aspect of golf swing mechanics is the beautiful sequence we see Tiger portraying below A slight shift of weight Rotation of the pelvis Rotation of the thorax Rotation of the shoulders, forearms and ulnar deviation release This is known as a kinematic sequence sequence of movements and it takes advantage of the summation of speed principle, where energy is generated in one segment, before being passed onto the next pelvis thorax arms club.

Understanding the Fundamentals of a Golf Swing

Understanding the fundamentals of a golf swing is crucial for any golfer, whether beginner or advanced. These basics form the foundation upon which more advanced techniques are built.

By mastering the core elements listed below, golfers can achieve a more consistent and effective swing, leading to improved performance on the course.

The Grip: How to Hold the Club

The grip is the first fundamental aspect of the golf swing. Your grip on the club will significantly impact the direction and distance of the shot. There are three main types of grips: the overlapping grip, the interlocking grip, and the 10-finger grip.

Each has its pros and cons; the key is to find the one that feels the most comfortable and allows you to control the club effectively.

An overlapping grip is commonly used by golfers with larger hands. This grip involves placing the pinky finger of the trailing hand between the index and middle fingers of the lead hand.

The interlocking grip, favored by players with smaller hands, involves interlocking the pinky finger of the trailing hand with the index finger of the lead hand.

In the 10-finger grip, also known as the baseball grip, all fingers of both hands grip the club independently. This grip is often recommended for beginners or those with weak hands.

A proper grip should be firm yet relaxed. The V’s formed by the thumb and index finger of both hands should point toward your right shoulder. (Note that this guide is aimed at right-handed players; if you’re left-handed, do the opposite.)

A strong grip can lead to a closed clubface at impact, causing a hook, while a weak grip can open the clubface, leading to a slice. Practicing your grip can help you find the right balance.

The Stance: Your Position Matters

Your stance is the next crucial element. A good stance sets the foundation for a balanced and powerful swing. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between them.

Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight. This posture allows for maximum mobility and balance.

The position of the ball in your stance can also affect your shot. For a driver, ensure the ball is parallel to the inside of your left heel. For shorter irons, ensure it is in the center of your stance. This positioning helps ensure solid contact with the ball and proper trajectory.

Your stance should also be adjusted based on the type of shot you’re attempting. For example, a wider stance can provide more stability for powerful drives, while a narrower stance can offer more control for precision shots.

Consistently practicing your stance will help you develop muscle memory and improve your overall swing.

The Backswing: Starting Your Swing Right

A proper backswing sets the stage for a powerful and accurate downswing. However, the backswing is where many golfers begin to lose control.

Start by rotating your shoulders while keeping your arms straight and your wrists firm. Your weight should shift to your back foot, and your hips should rotate slightly.

A common mistake is to swing the club too far back, which can lead to a loss of balance and control. Instead, focus on a smooth, controlled motion.

Pay attention to the position of your club at the top of the backswing. It should be parallel to the ground, with the clubface pointing slightly downward. This will allow for a more efficient transition into the downswing.

Think of your backswing as a wound-up coil, storing energy that will be released in the downswing. Practicing a balanced backswing can help you achieve a more powerful and accurate shot.

Consistency in your backswing will lead to more reliable shots and better performance on the course.

The Downswing: Powering Through

The downswing is where the power and speed of your swing come into play. It begins with a shift of your weight to your front foot, followed by the rotation of your hips and shoulders. Your arms should follow naturally, with the clubhead accelerating toward the ball.

A common mistake is to use too much upper-body strength, leading to an over-the-top swing path. If you have this problem, focus on using your lower body to initiate the downswing.

This will help you maintain balance and generate more power. The key is to allow your hips and shoulders to lead, with your arms and hands following.

As you approach impact, keep your eyes on the ball and your head steady. Your wrists should release naturally, allowing the clubface to make solid contact with the ball.

A proper downswing will result in a powerful, accurate shot with a consistent trajectory.

Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Even seasoned golfers can fall into bad habits that hinder their performance. Identifying and correcting these common mistakes can lead to significant improvements in your game.

By focusing on proper technique and making small adjustments, you can avoid these pitfalls and enhance your overall swing.

Incorrect Grip: Adjusting Your Hands

An incorrect grip can lead to inconsistent shots. An overly strong or weak grip can affect the clubface at impact, causing hooks or slices. Gripping the club too tightly can lead to tension in your arms and shoulders, affecting your swing’s fluidity.

Aim for a firm yet relaxed grip. Practicing your grip regularly can help you develop muscle memory and will improve the consistency of your swing.

If you’re unsure about your grip, consider seeking feedback from a golf coach or using training aids to help you find the correct hand position. The grip is fundamental to a successful swing, so it’s worth investing time in getting it right.

Poor Posture: Finding the Right Stance

Poor posture is another common issue that can affect your swing. Slouching or standing too upright can lead to a loss of balance and control. To correct this, focus on maintaining the posture described below.

Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed. Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight.

Another crucial aspect of posture is the alignment of your body. Your shoulders, hips, and feet should be parallel to the target line. Misalignment can lead to off-target shots and inconsistency.

Practicing your stance and alignment can help you develop a more balanced and controlled swing.

If you’re struggling with your posture, consider using a mirror or recording your swing to identify any issues. Making small adjustments to your posture can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance.

Swing Path Issues: Staying on Track

Swing path issues are common, especially for beginners. An incorrect swing path can lead to slices, hooks, and inconsistent shots.

To fix this, focus on a straight and controlled swing path. Your club should travel along the target line, with the clubhead staying square to the ball.

One of the most common mistakes is an over-the-top swing, where the club moves outside the target line on the downswing. This can lead to slices and loss of power.

To correct this, focus on initiating the downswing with your lower body, allowing your hips and shoulders to lead. This will help you maintain a more controlled and efficient swing path.

As always, using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach can help you identify and correct swing path issues.

Lack of Follow-Through: Completing Your Swing

A lack of follow-through can affect the power and accuracy of your shots. Completing your swing allows for a full release of energy and ensures proper contact with the ball.

To improve your follow-through, focus on maintaining a smooth and controlled motion throughout your swing.

A common mistake is attempting to stop the swing abruptly after impact. This can lead to loss of power and control. Allow your swing to continue naturally, with your club finishing high and your body facing the target.

Practicing your follow-through can help you develop a more powerful and accurate swing.

Making small adjustments to your follow-through can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance. If you’re struggling with your follow-through, consider using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach.

Tips to Improve Your Golf Swing

Improving your golf swing requires dedication and practice. By focusing on key aspects of your swing and incorporating effective training methods, you can achieve significant improvements.

Here are some tips to help you enhance your swing and take your game to the next level.

Practicing Consistently

Consistent practice is essential for improving your golf swing. Regular practice allows you to develop muscle memory and refine your technique.

Set aside dedicated time each week to work on your swing, focusing on different aspects such as grip, stance, and follow-through. Many players like to devote one session to each aspect; others prefer to mix it up.

It’s also important to practice with a purpose. Instead of mindlessly hitting balls, set specific goals for each practice session. This could include working on your grip, improving your swing path, or increasing your swing speed.

Consider using a practice journal to track your progress and identify areas for improvement. This can help you stay focused and motivated, leading to more effective practice sessions and better results on the course.

Using Training Aids

Training aids can be valuable tools for improving your golf swing. Various aids are available, each designed to address specific aspects of the swing.

For example, grip trainers can help you develop a proper grip, while alignment sticks can assist with maintaining a correct stance and swing path.

Another useful training aid is the swing analyzer, which provides real-time feedback on your swing mechanics. This can help you identify and correct any issues, leading to more consistent and accurate shots.

Using training aids regularly can enhance your practice sessions and accelerate your progress. When selecting training aids, choose those that address your specific needs and goals. Incorporating these aids into your practice routine will help you develop better habits and improve your overall swing.

Taking Lessons From a Pro

Taking lessons from a professional golf coach can provide valuable insights and guidance. A coach can help you identify and correct any flaws in your swing, leading to more significant improvements. Additionally, a coach can provide personalized advice and drills tailored to your needs and goals.

When choosing a coach, look for someone with experience and a proven track record. Reading reviews and seeking recommendations can help you find a coach who is a good fit for you.

Taking lessons from a pro can be a worthwhile investment in your game. Consider scheduling regular lessons to maintain consistent progress. A coach can help you stay focused and motivated, leading to more effective practice sessions and better results on the course.

Analyzing Your Swing With Video

Analyzing your swing with video can provide valuable feedback and insights. Recording your swing allows you to see what you’re doing right and identify areas for improvement.

Use a smartphone or camera to record your swing from different angles, including front, side, and rear views. As you review the footage, look for issues with your grip, stance, swing path, or follow-through.

Additionally, comparing your swing to that of professional golfers can provide a benchmark for what you’re aiming to achieve.

Consider using video analysis software to enhance your review process. These tools allow you to slow down and home in on specific aspects of your swing, providing more detailed feedback.

If you’re having trouble discovering where you’re going wrong, consider enlisting the services of a golf coach.

The Role of Equipment in Your Golf Swing

The right equipment can significantly impact your golf swing and overall performance. Using clubs and balls that are suited to your needs can help you achieve better results.

Understanding the role of equipment in your swing can help you make more informed choices and optimize your game.

Choosing the Right Clubs

Choosing the right clubs is essential for achieving a consistent and effective swing. Different clubs are designed for different purposes, so it’s important to select those that match your skill level and playing style.

For example, beginners may benefit from using clubs with a larger sweet spot, while more advanced players may prefer clubs that offer greater control and precision.

When selecting clubs, consider factors such as loft, shaft length, and clubhead design. These elements can affect the trajectory, distance, and accuracy of your shots.

Additionally, having your clubs custom-fitted can ensure they are tailored to your unique swing characteristics.

Consider seeking advice from a professional club fitter or golf coach when choosing your clubs. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your needs and goals.

Importance of Proper Golf Balls

Using the right golf balls can enhance your swing and overall performance. Different golf balls are designed for different playing conditions and skill levels. For example, some balls are designed to provide greater distance, while others offer more control and spin.

When selecting golf balls, consider factors such as compression, cover material, and dimple pattern. These elements can affect the ball’s flight, feel, and performance. Additionally, using the same type of ball consistently can help you achieve more predictable results.

Experimenting with different golf balls can help you find the one that best suits your game. Consider seeking advice from a golf coach or professional when selecting your balls.

Maintenance of Your Gear

Proper maintenance of your gear is essential for achieving consistent results. Regularly cleaning your clubs and balls can help ensure they perform at their best.

Additionally, inspecting your equipment for signs of wear and tear can help you identify any issues and address them promptly.

Storing your gear properly can also help extend its lifespan. Keep your clubs in a cool, dry place and avoid exposing them to extreme temperatures.

Similarly, store your golf balls in a cool, dry place to maintain their performance characteristics.

Consider using protective covers for your clubs to prevent damage during transport. And be sure to regularly check and replace grips, as this will ensure you can maintain control over your swing.

A proper grip should be firm yet relaxed. The Vs formed by the thumb and index finger of both hands should point toward your right shoulder. Note that this guide is aimed at right-handed players if youre left-handed, do the opposite. A strong grip can lead to a closed clubface at impact, causing a hook, while a weak grip can open the clubface, leading to a slice. Practicing your grip can help you find the right balance. The Stance Your Position Matters Your stance is the next crucial element. A good stance sets the foundation for a balanced and powerful swing. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed between them. Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight. This posture allows for maximum mobility and balance. The position of the ball in your stance can also affect your shot. For a driver, ensure the ball is parallel to the inside of your left heel. For shorter irons, ensure it is in the center of your stance. This positioning helps ensure solid contact with the ball and proper trajectory. Your stance should also be adjusted based on the type of shot youre attempting. For example, a wider stance can provide more stability for powerful drives, while a narrower stance can offer more control for precision shots. Consistently practicing your stance will help you develop muscle memory and improve your overall swing. The Backswing Starting Your Swing Right A proper backswing sets the stage for a powerful and accurate downswing. However, the backswing is where many golfers begin to lose control. Start by rotating your shoulders while keeping your arms straight and your wrists firm. Your weight should shift to your back foot, and your hips should rotate slightly. A common mistake is to swing the club too far back, which can lead to a loss of balance and control. Instead, focus on a smooth, controlled motion. Pay attention to the position of your club at the top of the backswing. It should be parallel to the ground, with the clubface pointing slightly downward. This will allow for a more efficient transition into the downswing. Think of your backswing as a wound-up coil, storing energy that will be released in the downswing. Practicing a balanced backswing can help you achieve a more powerful and accurate shot. Consistency in your backswing will lead to more reliable shots and better performance on the course. The Downswing Powering Through The downswing is where the power and speed of your swing come into play. It begins with a shift of your weight to your front foot, followed by the rotation of your hips and shoulders. Your arms should follow naturally, with the clubhead accelerating toward the ball. A common mistake is to use too much upper-body strength, leading to an over-the-top swing path. If you have this problem, focus on using your lower body to initiate the downswing. This will help you maintain balance and generate more power. The key is to allow your hips and shoulders to lead, with your arms and hands following. As you approach impact, keep your eyes on the ball and your head steady. Your wrists should release naturally, allowing the clubface to make solid contact with the ball. A proper downswing will result in a powerful, accurate shot with a consistent trajectory. Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them Even seasoned golfers can fall into bad habits that hinder their performance. Identifying and correcting these common mistakes can lead to significant improvements in your game. By focusing on proper technique and making small adjustments, you can avoid these pitfalls and enhance your overall swing. Incorrect Grip Adjusting Your Hands An incorrect grip can lead to inconsistent shots. An overly strong or weak grip can affect the', 'to your front foot, followed by the rotation of your hips and shoulders.

Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them Even seasoned golfers can fall into bad habits that hinder their performance. Identifying and correcting these common mistakes can lead to significant improvements in your game. By focusing on proper technique and making small adjustments, you can avoid these pitfalls and enhance your overall swing. Incorrect Grip Adjusting Your Hands An incorrect grip can lead to inconsistent shots. An overly strong or weak grip can affect the clubface at impact, causing hooks or slices. Gripping the club too tightly can lead to tension in your arms and shoulders, affecting your swings fluidity. Aim for a firm yet relaxed grip. Practicing your grip regularly can help you develop muscle memory and will improve the consistency of your swing. If youre unsure about your grip, consider seeking feedback from a golf coach or using training aids to help you find the correct hand position. The grip is fundamental to a successful swing, so its worth investing time in getting it right. Poor Posture Finding the Right Stance Poor posture is another common issue that can affect your swing. Slouching or standing too upright can lead to a loss of balance and control. To correct this, focus on maintaining the posture described below. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your weight evenly distributed. Bend your knees slightly and tilt your upper body forward from the hips, keeping your back straight. Another crucial aspect of posture is the alignment of your body. Your shoulders, hips, and feet should be parallel to the target line. Misalignment can lead to off-target shots and inconsistency. Practicing your stance and alignment can help you develop a more balanced and controlled swing. If youre struggling with your posture, consider using a mirror or recording your swing to identify any issues. Making small adjustments to your posture can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance. Swing Path Issues Staying on Track Swing path issues are common, especially for beginners. An incorrect swing path can lead to slices, hooks, and inconsistent shots. To fix this, focus on a straight and controlled swing path. Your club should travel along the target line, with the clubhead staying square to the ball. One of the most common mistakes is an over-the-top swing, where the club moves outside the target line on the downswing. This can lead to slices and loss of power. To correct this, focus on initiating the downswing with your lower body, allowing your hips and shoulders to lead. This will help you maintain a more controlled and efficient swing path. As always, using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach can help you identify and correct swing path issues. Lack of Follow-Through Completing Your Swing A lack of follow-through can affect the power and accuracy of your shots. Completing your swing allows for a full release of energy and ensures proper contact with the ball. To improve your follow-through, focus on maintaining a smooth and controlled motion throughout your swing. A common mistake is attempting to stop the swing abruptly after impact. This can lead to loss of power and control. Allow your swing to continue naturally, with your club finishing high and your body facing the target. Practicing your follow-through can help you develop a more powerful and accurate swing. Making small adjustments to your follow-through can lead to significant improvements in your swing and overall performance. If youre struggling with your follow-through, consider using training aids or seeking feedback from a golf coach.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9227529/,Golf Swing Biomechanics: A Systematic Review and Methodological Recommendations for Kinematics,"Estimating joint kinematics involves computing the relative motion between the segments. This permits a description of the movement regardless of the measurement coordinate system. This approach simplifies the description of motion as angles, which are given according to anatomical degrees of freedom. For instance, one would prefer to describe elbow flexion or pronosupination rather than the absolute positions of the arm and forearm within the laboratory measurement coordinate system. To simplify the analysis, the ISB has provided recommendations for defining anatomical frames for segments and joints [ 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 ].

The movements can be described using two different methods. The first relies on the direct use of experimental marker trajectories to define the segment reference frame in space and estimate the angles between the segment reference frames. The second method uses a multibody kinematic optimization technique [ 106 ]. The first is easier to implement but is more influenced by marker occlusion and soft tissue artifacts. The second permits the consideration of joint constraints to describe more physiological movements [ 107 ]. Recently, Mahadas et al. [ 108 ] highlighted the usefulness of OpenSim [ 109 , 110 ], an open-source software based on this methodology, for golf swing analysis.

3.8.2. Commentary on the Results

This section is mainly focused on joint angular kinematics; tables with typical values for each joint are provided after the commentaries on the results.

Ankle No publication has provided information on ankle kinematics during golf swing with the movement analysis standard of the ISB [49,50,51,52].

Knees Twelve studies considered the knee joint, and only four reported joint angles [47,111,112,113]. Several studies have focused on knee dynamics without providing results on knee kinematics. Murakami et al. [112] performed a reference analysis by creating a three-dimensional (3D) model with a scanner and then performing bone tracking with X-ray images (with 3D model adjustment). This approach is theoretically more accurate, but they only considered six instants (address, early backswing, late backswing, top-of-the-backswing, impact, and end of the follow-through). These values are reported in Table 4. The authors measured a cohort of five recreational golfers, and they can be considered as reference values for studies using optoelectronic motion capture systems, which measured similar values [47,111,113]. Somjarod et al. [113] studied professional and recreational golfers and measured a higher flexion for professionals of approximately 3° at the top-of-backswing (25° vs. 29°). Egret et al. [47] measured a lower flexion of approximately 20° in women compared to men (16 ± 6° vs. 35 ± 5°). Internal–external rotation of the knee has also been measured by Murakami et al. [112]. For the leading side, the global amplitude ranged from −7° to 10°, whereas it varied from −16° to 10° for the trail side. Abduction–adduction kinematics of the knee were investigated by Kim et al. [114,115], who aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a lateral heel wedge to reduce knee pain or anterior cruciate ligament rupture. They measured angles between 0.42 ± 0.73° and 5.95 ± 2.91° without the wedge club and between 0.30 ± 0.86° and 5.99 ± 3.17° with a wedge. They concluded that the wedge may reduce varus moment, but they did not show any results in terms of joint dynamics. However, these values were very similar, highlighting a trend. Although Murakami et al. [112] used two-dimensional (2D) scanner images, they estimated an accuracy of 0.3° for the rotation. However, the article by Ishimaru et al. [116], presented as the reference for method accuracy, studied patellar movement. The validation of the rotation accuracy seemed to be only performed for elementary movements with a lower acquisition frequency (three versus ten images per second). The study focused on elderly patients who underwent knee arthroplasty, and validation was performed on pig cadavers. Thus, one may expect lower accuracy for this more complex movement. This could explain the differences between the scanner image method and the optoelectronic method. However, the study of Murakami et al. [112] was the only one able to measure the antero-posterior translation during movement: 4.6 ± 9.2 mm for the lead side and 4.1 ± 3.6 mm for the trail side. The knee kinematics of recreational golfers have been shown to differ from those of professional golfers. Kim et al. [117] highlighted that professional golfers flexed their trail knee less, and Choi et al. [32,111], measured a second peak for a golfer lead knee. In contrast, Somjarod et al. [113] did not find any significant differences in trail knee flexion between professional and recreational golfers. Somjarod et al. [113]. also measured internal–external rotation of the knee, but their values were different between professional (−20° at the top of backswing) and recreational (−26° at the top of backswing) golfers. However, even though they presented values for the knee, these values appeared closer to the hip values. The method used was not well-detailed in the article, making it difficult to analyze the data, especially because the link between hip and knee internal–external rotations remains unknown. Finally, Purevsuren et al. [118] investigated the link between anterior cruciate ligament injury risk and knee kinematics. They highlighted the increase in ACL loading with decreased knee flexion and increased tibial rotation [118].

Hips Eleven studies considered hip kinematics [32,47,112,117,119,120,121,122,123,124] and eight articles reported joint angles [47,117,119,120,121,122,124]. One publication [112] reported values based on femur movement without the pelvis, which is needed to create the hip joint frame. Only two studies [32,117] decomposed the hip angle into its three basic components, but only the study by Kim et al. [117] reported hip joint kinematic values. The values are listed in Table 4. Other studies have provided superior values for hip angles. It was shown that hip movements were highly asymmetric [121], and a higher internal–external range of motion was observed for the lead hip than for the trail hip. The lead hip used almost the entire physiological range of motion of the hip in external rotation, backswing, and internal rotation during the downswing. This was confirmed by Alderslade et al. [119], who measured the hip internal–external rotation during the swing that remained within the passive angular corridor. In addition, lead hip movement was found to be highly linked to torso movement and was positively correlated with clubhead speed at ball impact [120]. Mun et al. [124] showed that rotation was initiated by the lead hip, followed by the lumbar spine; for professional golfers, lumbar and lead hip rotations were equally distributed. A lack of mobility for the lead hip has been linked to higher use of the lumbar spine [117]. This could explain the efficiency of a hip-stretching program in limiting low-back pain occurrence when golfers lack hip mobility [125]. Finally, Egret et al. [47] highlighted the differences between women and men, with higher hip movement amplitudes for women. Finally, one publication [126] investigated the joint angle differences induced by slight modifications to the ball position at the address. With the ball position varying by 4.3 cm, the hip flexion was modified up to 1.5° relative to the reference position. However, the mean variation was within the standard deviation of the reference frame, and the authors only considered the flexion–extension of the hips.

Torso Torso kinematics during golf swings have often been studied. Some authors included more details than on the X-factor. There were three different approaches: injury prevention, performance improvement, and group difference investigation. To date, two studies have focused on the modern swing, which is characterized by the need for a higher axial rotation of the torso. They suggested that the modern swing was associated with a higher injury risk in the lumbar spine [62,127]. However, Lindsay et al. [75] did not measure any significant kinematic differences between asymptomatic players and players with low-back pain, using a driver. Kim et al. [117] found that a lack of hip internal–external rotation was compensated by a modification of the pelvis kinematics, in particular, the posterior tilt and flexion of the lumbar spine. It was also demonstrated that an increase in torso axial rotation was correlated with an increase in the clubhead speed at ball impact [128], which is the same effect as the X-factor. Okuda et al. and Zheng et al. [48,129] found that skilled golfers began their torso rotation earlier than less-skilled golfers. Chu et al. [38] suggested that flexion/extension and lateral bending of the torso are kinematic parameters involved in performance. Furthermore, Joyce et al. [130] estimated that torso kinematics contributed 34–67% of the performance variance. Two studies identified coupling between torso and pelvis rotations, suggesting that experienced golfers succeeded in modifying their neuronal networks to synchronize their movements. For professional players, Beak et al. [131] found a correlation between torso and pelvis speed peaks. Sex-related differences were also assessed. On the one hand, Zheng et al. [132] showed that torso rotations were not significantly different between genders. On the other hand, Horan et al. [31] showed that men and women did not have the same optimal swing, and torso and pelvis movements were not the same between sexes. Lindsay et al. [75] showed that the torso kinematics differed according to the club used. The results differed when using a driver or 7-iron for flexion and lateral bending. Finally, Horan et al. [133] highlighted that performing a putting session before swinging improved torso mobility, specifically for women. This is quite contradictory to Henry et al. [63], who found no effect on the X-factor value of the warm-up before swinging. One publication [126] investigated the differences induced by slight modifications of the ball position at the address, although they did not directly correlate their findings with performance. The torso side bending and torso flexion were measured in the global frame. Only torso flexion was modified by with a minimal modification of about 1°. One publication [134] measured the coupling between the pelvis and torso rotation angles and highlighted different patterns depending on golfer skills.

Neck Only three studies considered neck kinematics or head movements [32,46,58]. In particular, Horan et al. [46] presented a new kinematics sequence: head, pelvis, and torso, in terms of rotational speeds for their participants. They measured a speed of approximately 210 ± 56°/s. However, the interest in taking the head for the kinematic sequence remains unclear.

Shoulder The shoulder joints have often been studied. However, the marker sets used were often minimal. The more common marker set (torso: manubrium, xyphoïd, acromions, 7th cervical vertebra, and 10th or 8th thoracic vertebra; arm: lateral and/or medial epicondyles of the humerus) was used to study the glenohumeral joint, with the assumption that the scapular girdles (clavicles and scapulae) were motionless in the torso. Ferdinands et al. [58] measured the global shoulder speed of approximately 6 rad/s. Teu et al. [135]. measured the contribution of each degree of freedom to the clubhead and estimated the internal/external rotation of the arm to contribute 14%, adduction/abduction 12%, and retroversion/anteversion 1%. Some studies have focused on sex differences and have shown kinematic differences between them. Zheng et al. [132] measured a significant difference in shoulder orientation, defined as the angle of the acromia line relative to the room frame. Egret et al. [47] measured a significant difference between men (82°*) and women (110°*). Variation induced by skill differences was also investigated. On the one hand, Choi et al. [32] measured no significant difference regarding shoulder kinematic smoothness (based on the jerk computation, the time derivative of acceleration). On the other hand, Healy et al. [136] measured a higher value of right shoulder flexion at the top of the backswing for experienced golfers, with a higher clubhead speed at impact with 5-iron. Egret et al. [30] also showed that experienced players appear to have a larger shoulder angle than less experienced players. Mitchell et al. [137] measured the variation in joint mobility in groups of golfers of various ages. They measured the decrease in shoulder mobility with age. Adduction in the horizontal plane was an exception, with an increase during the backswing. Finally, differences induced by clubs were investigated by Egret et al. [138], who found shoulder kinematic differences between drivers and 5-iron clubs and between drivers and pitching wedges, but not between 5-iron and pitching wedges. One study [126] investigated the differences induced by slight modifications in the ball position at the address. However, the induced modifications were very small for shoulder kinematics (less than 1° between configurations) and not statistically significant. Finally, one publication [25] addressed the issue of the negative effect of using a rough model for golf swing kinematic processing. They showed that even if the glenohumeral joint was the only one considered for golf swing analysis, the scapulothoracic and thoracoclavicular joints are used during the golf swing. Consequently, an inaccurate model of the shoulder joint may lead to inaccuracies in neighboring segments. Furthermore, they also published the values of inverse kinematics during the golf swing.

Elbow Even though elbows are often studied, their role in performance remains unknown. Only Zheng et al. [48,132], and Egret et al. [47] highlighted a kinematic difference; the more skilled the players are, the more able they are to extend their elbow during the swing. Additionally, according to Egret et al. [47], professional women seemed to have a faster elbow extension than professional men. They also measured [47] a higher amplitude for women than men, with a smaller angle at the top of the backswing and a higher angle at impact, which was in agreement with Zheng et al. [132]. From an injury point of view, McHardy et al. [3] showed that recreational golfers and women were more likely to have an elbow injury than professional golfers and men, respectively.","['Maxime Bourgain', 'Arts Et Metiers Institute Of Technology', 'Université Sorbonne Paris Nord', 'Ibhgc Institut De Biomécanique Humaine Georges Charpak', 'Hesam Université', 'Bd De L Hôpital', 'Paris', 'France', 'Philippe.Rouch Epf.Fr', 'P.R.']",2022-06-09 00:00:00,pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,"Estimating joint kinematics involves computing the relative motion between the segments.

Murakami et al. 112 performed a reference analysis by creating a three-dimensional 3D model with a scanner and then performing bone tracking with X-ray images with 3D model adjustment. This approach is theoretically more accurate, but they only considered six instants address, early backswing, late backswing, top-of-the-backswing, impact, and end of the follow-through. These values are reported in Table 4. The authors measured a cohort of five recreational golfers, and they can be considered as reference values for studies using optoelectronic motion capture systems, which measured similar values 47,111,113. Somjarod et al. 113 studied professional and recreational golfers and measured a higher flexion for professionals of approximately 3 at the top-of-backswing 25 vs. 29. Egret et al. 47 measured a lower flexion of approximately 20 in women compared to men 16  6 vs. 35  5. Internalexternal rotation of the knee has also been measured by Murakami et al. 112. For the leading side, the global amplitude ranged from 7 to 10, whereas it varied from 16 to 10 for the trail side. Abductionadduction kinematics of the knee were investigated by Kim et al. 114,115, who aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of using a lateral heel wedge to reduce knee pain or anterior cruciate ligament rupture. They measured angles between 0.42  0.73 and 5.95  2.91 without the wedge club and between 0.30  0.86 and 5.99  3.17 with a wedge. They concluded that the wedge may reduce varus moment, but they did not show any results in terms of joint dynamics. However, these values were very similar, highlighting a trend. Although Murakami et al. 112 used two-dimensional 2D scanner images, they estimated an accuracy of 0.3 for the rotation. However, the article by Ishimaru et al. 116, presented as the reference for method accuracy, studied patellar movement. The validation of the rotation accuracy seemed to be only performed for elementary movements with a lower acquisition frequency three versus ten images per second. The study focused on elderly patients who underwent knee arthroplasty, and validation was performed on pig cadavers. Thus, one may expect lower accuracy for this more complex movement. This could explain the differences between the scanner image method and the optoelectronic method. However, the study of Murakami et al. 112 was the only one able to measure the antero-posterior translation during movement 4.6  9.2 mm for the lead side and 4.1  3.6 mm for the trail side. The knee kinematics of recreational golfers have been shown to differ from those of professional golfers. Kim et al. 117 highlighted that professional golfers flexed their trail knee less, and Choi et al. 32,111, measured a second peak for a golfer lead knee. In contrast, Somjarod et al. 113 did not find any significant differences in trail knee flexion between professional and recreational golfers. Somjarod et al. 113. also measured internalexternal rotation of the knee, but their values were different between professional 20 at the top of backswing and recreational 26 at the top of backswing golfers. However, even though they presented values for the knee, these values appeared closer to the hip values. The method used was not well-detailed in the article, making it difficult to analyze the data, especially because the link between hip and knee internalexternal rotations remains unknown. Finally, Purevsuren et al. 118 investigated the link between anterior cruciate ligament injury risk and knee kinematics. They highlighted the increase in ACL loading with decreased knee flexion and increased tibial rotation 118. Hips Eleven studies considered hip kinematics 32,47,112,117,119,120,121,122,123,124 and eight articles reported joint angles 47,117,119,120,121,122,124. One publication 112 reported values based on femur movement without the pelvis, which is needed to create the hip joint frame. Only two studies 32,117 decomposed the hip angle into its three basic components, but only the study by Kim et al. 117 reported hip joint kinematic values. The values are listed in Table 4. Other studies have provided superior values for hip angles. It was shown that hip movements were highly asymmetric 121, and a higher internalexternal range of motion was observed for the lead hip than for the trail hip. The lead hip used almost the entire physiological range of motion of the hip in external rotation, backswing, and internal rotation during the downswing. This was confirmed by Alderslade et al. 119, who measured the hip internalexternal rotation during the swing that remained within the passive angular corridor. In addition, lead hip movement was found to be highly linked to torso movement and was positively correlated with clubhead speed at ball impact 120. Mun et al. 124 showed that rotation was initiated by the lead hip, followed by the lumbar spine for professional golfers, lumbar and lead hip rotations were equally distributed. A lack of mobility for the lead hip has been linked to higher use of the lumbar spine 117. This could explain the efficiency of a hip-stretching program in limiting low-back pain occurrence when golfers lack hip mobility 125. Finally, Egret et al. 47 highlighted the differences between women and men, with higher hip movement amplitudes for women. Finally, one publication 126 investigated the joint angle differences induced by slight modifications to the ball position at the address. With the ball position varying by 4.3 cm, the hip flexion was modified up to 1.5 relative to the reference position. However, the mean variation was within the standard deviation of the reference frame, and the authors only considered the flexionextension of the hips. Torso Torso kinematics during golf swings have often been studied. Some authors included more details than on the X-factor. There were three different approaches injury prevention, performance improvement, and group difference investigation. To date, two studies have focused on the modern swing, which is characterized by the need for a higher axial rotation of the torso. They suggested that the modern swing was associated with a higher injury risk in the lumbar spine 62,127. However, Lindsay et al. 75 did not measure any significant kinematic differences between asymptomatic players and players with low-back pain, using a driver. Kim et al. 117 found that a lack of hip internalexternal rotation was compensated by a modification of the pelvis kinematics, in particular, the posterior tilt and flexion of the lumbar spine. It was also demonstrated that an increase in torso axial rotation was correlated with an increase in the clubhead speed at ball impact 128, which is the same effect as the X-factor. Okuda et al. and Zheng et al. 48,129 found that skilled golfers began their torso rotation earlier than less-skilled golfers. Chu et al. 38 suggested that flexionextension and lateral bending of the torso are kinematic parameters involved in performance. Furthermore, Joyce et al. 130 estimated that torso kinematics contributed 3467 of the performance variance. Two studies identified coupling between torso and pelvis rotations, suggesting that experienced golfers succeeded in modifying their neuronal networks to synchronize their movements. For professional players, Beak et al. 131 found a correlation between torso and pelvis speed peaks. Sex-related differences were also assessed. On the one hand, Zheng et al. 132 showed that torso rotations were not significantly different between genders. On the other hand, Horan et al. 31 showed that men and women did not have the same optimal swing, and torso and pelvis movements were not the same between sexes. Lindsay et al. 75 showed that the torso kinematics differed according to the club used. The results differed when using a driver or 7-iron for flexion and lateral bending. Finally, Horan et al. 133 highlighted that performing a putting session before swinging improved torso mobility, specifically for women. This is quite contradictory to Henry et al. 63, who found no effect on the X-factor value of the warm-up before swinging. One publication 126 investigated the differences induced by slight modifications of the ball position at the address, although they did not directly correlate their findings with performance. The torso side bending and torso flexion were measured in the global frame. Only torso flexion was modified by with a minimal modification of about 1. One publication 134 measured the coupling between the pelvis and torso rotation angles and highlighted different patterns depending on golfer skills. Neck Only three studies considered neck kinematics or head movements 32,46,58. In particular, Horan et al. 46 presented a new kinematics sequence head, pelvis, and torso, in terms of rotational speeds for their participants. They measured a speed of approximately 210  56s. However, the interest in taking the head for the kinematic sequence remains unclear. Shoulder The shoulder joints have often been studied. However, the marker sets used were often minimal. The more common marker set torso manubrium, xyphoïd, acromions, 7th cervical vertebra, and 10th or 8th thoracic vertebra arm lateral andor medial epicondyles of the humerus was used to study the glenohumeral joint, with the assumption that the scapular girdles clavicles and scapulae were motionless in the torso. Ferdinands et al. 58 measured the global shoulder speed of approximately 6 rads. Teu et al. 135. measured the contribution of each degree of freedom to the clubhead and estimated the internalexternal rotation of the arm to contribute 14, adductionabduction 12, and retroversionanteversion 1. Some studies have focused on sex differences and have shown kinematic differences between them. Zheng et al. 132 measured a significant difference in shoulder orientation, defined as the angle of the acromia line relative to the room frame. Egret et al. 47 measured a significant difference between men 82 and women 110. Variation induced by skill differences was also investigated. On the one hand, Choi et al. 32 measured no significant difference regarding shoulder kinematic smoothness based on the jerk computation, the time derivative of acceleration. On the other hand, Healy et al. 136 measured a higher value of right shoulder flexion at the top of the backswing for experienced golfers, with a higher clubhead speed at impact with 5-iron. Egret et al. 30 also showed that experienced players appear to have a larger shoulder angle than less experienced players. Mitchell et al. 137 measured the variation in joint mobility in groups of golfers of various ages. They measured the decrease in shoulder mobility with age. Adduction in the horizontal plane was an exception, with an increase during the backswing. Finally, differences induced by clubs were investigated by Egret et al. 138, who found shoulder kinematic differences between drivers and 5-iron clubs and between drivers and pitching wedges, but not between 5-iron and pitching wedges. One study 126 investigated the differences induced by slight modifications in the ball position at the address. However, the induced modifications were very small for shoulder kinematics less than 1 between configurations and not statistically significant. Finally, one publication 25 addressed the issue of the negative effect of using a rough model for golf swing kinematic processing. They showed that even if the glenohumeral joint was the only one considered for golf swing analysis, the scapulothoracic and thoracoclavicular joints are used during the golf swing. Consequently, an inaccurate model of the shoulder joint may lead to inaccuracies in neighboring segments. Furthermore, they also published the values of inverse kinematics during the golf swing. Elbow Even though elbows are often studied, their role in performance remains unknown. Only Zheng et al. 48,132, and Egret et al. 47 highlighted a kinematic difference the more skilled the players are, the more able they are to extend their elbow during the swing. Additionally, according to Egret et al. 47, professional women seemed to have a faster elbow extension than professional men. They also measured 47 a higher amplitude for women than men, with a smaller angle at the top of the backswing and a higher angle at impact, which was in agreement with Zheng et al. 132. From an injury point of view, McHardy et al. 3 showed that recreational golfers and women were more likely to have an elbow injury than professional golfers and men, respectively.","['Estimating joint kinematics involves computing the relative motion between the segments. This permits a description of the movement regardless of the measurement coordinate system. This approach simplifies the description of motion as angles, which are given according to anatomical degrees of freedom. For instance, one would prefer to describe elbow flexion or pronosupination rather than the absolute positions of the arm and forearm within the laboratory measurement coordinate system. To simplify the analysis, the ISB has provided recommendations for defining anatomical frames for segments and joints 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 . The movements can be described using two different methods. The first relies on the direct use of experimental marker trajectories to define the segment reference frame in space and estimate the angles between the segment reference frames. The second method uses a multibody kinematic optimization technique 106 . The first is easier to implement but is more influenced by marker occlusion and soft tissue artifacts. The second permits the consideration of joint constraints to describe more physiological movements 107 . Recently, Mahadas et al. 108 highlighted the usefulness of OpenSim 109 , 110 , an open-source software based on this methodology, for golf swing analysis. 3.8.2. Commentary on the Results This section is mainly focused on joint angular kinematics tables with typical values for each joint are provided after the commentaries on the results.

This article doesn’t just skim the surface of the golf swing it dives deep, incorporating not only my personal journey to a better swing but also insights from golf pros and statistical data that illustrate common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

Learn to Improve Your Golf Swing The Grip: Correct hand placement is crucial.

Correct hand placement is crucial. The Stance: Position your feet properly for balance.

Position your feet properly for balance. The Backswing, Downswing, Follow-Through: Essential steps for a powerful swing.

1. The Grip

The grip is your only connection to the golf club, and yet, it’s often the most overlooked aspect of a golfer’s game. I remember the first time a pro adjusted my grip; it felt completely foreign, yet it corrected years of self-taught errors. The grip dictates the club’s face angle at impact, influencing the ball’s flight path significantly.

For a proper grip, place the club in your non-dominant hand so that it sits diagonally across your fingers, from the base of the index finger to just below the pinkie’s pad. Your dominant hand then comes in to complement this hold, either linking (for most players) or overlapping (for those seeking a softer grip) the index finger of the non-dominant hand with the pinkie of the dominant hand.

Insider Tip: Spend at least five minutes during each practice session checking and correcting your grip, as suggested by a PGA tour coach. Small adjustments can lead to big improvements.

2. The Stance

Your stance is the foundation of your swing. A shaky foundation equals a shaky swing. The ideal stance is both comfortable and balanced, allowing you to swing the club with power and precision. Feet should be shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your weight evenly distributed between the balls of your feet and your heels.

I once had the habit of leaning too far forward, which I learned, limits the backswing and affects the swing path. Correcting this took conscious effort and a lot of mirror work, but it paid off in more consistent ball striking.

Insider Tip: Practice your stance in front of a mirror to ensure your back is straight and you’re not leaning too far forward or backward.

3. The Backswing

The backswing sets the stage for the downswing; it’s where power is built. A common mistake is to rush this part of the swing, which can throw off your timing and balance. A proper backswing feels smooth and controlled. The club should be taken back in a straight line, with the shoulders turning while the hips stay relatively quiet.

One game-changing tip I received was to think of the backswing as a coiling motion, maximizing potential energy. This mental image helped me improve the smoothness and power of my swing.

Insider Tip: Record your backswing with a smartphone. Watching yourself can reveal inconsistencies in your motion that you can’t feel.

Real-Life Example: Overcoming a Slice with Proper Backswing

John’s Struggle with a Slice

Growing up, John always struggled with slicing the ball when he played golf. No matter how hard he tried, the ball always seemed to veer off course. Frustrated, he sought advice from a golf instructor who pointed out that his backswing was the root of the issue.

Applying Proper Backswing Techniques

John diligently worked on improving his backswing, focusing on keeping his hands in the correct position and maintaining a smooth motion. With practice, he started to notice a significant difference in the trajectory of his shots. The ball flew straighter and farther, giving John the confidence he needed to enjoy the game even more.

The Impact of a Correct Backswing

By mastering the backswing technique, John was able to overcome his slice and improve his overall golf game. He learned firsthand the importance of proper backswing mechanics and how it can make a world of difference in the outcome of each shot.

4. The Downswing

The downswing is where the magic happens, where power is transferred to the ball. The key here is sequencing; the hips lead, then the torso, followed by the arms, and finally, the club. Getting this sequence right ensures maximum power and accuracy.

I learned the hard way that trying to start the downswing with my arms led to slices and inconsistent contact. Focusing on starting with my hips improved my ball striking significantly.

Insider Tip: Use a drill that emphasizes hip movement at the start of the downswing. This can help ingrain the proper sequence.

5. The Follow-Through

The follow-through is often seen as just a formality, but it’s actually a good indicator of the quality of your swing. A balanced, controlled follow-through suggests a swing that was equally balanced and controlled. Your body should be facing the target, with your weight shifted onto your front foot.

Working on my follow-through helped me understand the concept of swinging through the ball, not just to it, which made my shots more powerful and accurate.

Insider Tip: Focus on finishing with your chest facing the target and your back foot on its toes. This ensures a complete weight transfer.

6. The Finish

A graceful finish is the hallmark of a good golf swing. It indicates that you’ve maintained balance and control throughout the swing. In a proper finish, your weight is fully shifted onto the front foot, and the club is wrapped around your back, with the butt of the club pointing toward the target.

Early in my golf journey, I often found myself off-balance at the finish, a sign of issues earlier in my swing. Correcting this not only improved my balance but also the consistency and power of my shots.

Insider Tip: Practice swinging to a balanced finish, even without hitting a ball. This can improve muscle memory and balance.

7. Practice, Practice, Practice

Improvement in golf, as in anything, requires practice. But not just any practice focused, deliberate practice. Each session should have a goal, whether it’s working on your grip, stance, or swing sequence. Quality over quantity is the mantra.

I’ve found incorporating specific drills into my practice routine to be incredibly beneficial. For example, using a doorframe to check my swing path or placing a tee on the ground to practice my follow-through has led to noticeable improvements in my game.

Insider Tip: Divide your practice time between swing mechanics and actual play. Spending time on the course puts your practice into context.

This article doesnt just skim the surface of the golf swing it dives deep, incorporating not only my personal journey to a better swing but also insights from golf pros and statistical data that illustrate common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Learn to Improve Your Golf Swing The Grip Correct hand placement is crucial. Correct hand placement is crucial. The Stance Position your feet properly for balance. Position your feet properly for balance. The Backswing, Downswing, Follow-Through Essential steps for a powerful swing. 1. The Grip The grip is your only connection to the golf club, and yet, its often the most overlooked aspect of a golfers game. I remember the first time a pro adjusted my grip it felt completely foreign, yet it corrected years of self-taught errors. The grip dictates the clubs face angle at impact, influencing the balls flight path significantly. For a proper grip, place the club in your non-dominant hand so that it sits diagonally across your fingers, from the base of the index finger to just below the pinkies pad. Your dominant hand then comes in to complement this hold, either linking for most players or overlapping for those seeking a softer grip the index finger of the non-dominant hand with the pinkie of the dominant hand. Insider Tip Spend at least five minutes during each practice session checking and correcting your grip, as suggested by a PGA tour coach. Small adjustments can lead to big improvements. 2. The Stance Your stance is the foundation of your swing. A shaky foundation equals a shaky swing. The ideal stance is both comfortable and balanced, allowing you to swing the club with power and precision. Feet should be shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your weight evenly distributed between the balls of your feet and your heels. I once had the habit of leaning too far forward, which I learned, limits the backswing and affects the swing path. Correcting this took conscious effort and a lot of mirror work, but it paid off in more consistent ball striking. Insider Tip Practice your stance in front of a mirror to ensure your back is straight and youre not leaning too far forward or backward. 3. The Backswing The backswing sets the stage for the downswing its where power is built. A common mistake is to rush this part of the swing, which can throw off your timing and balance. A proper backswing feels smooth and controlled. The club should be taken back in a straight line, with the shoulders turning while the hips stay relatively quiet. One game-changing tip I received was to think of the backswing as a coiling motion, maximizing potential energy. This mental image helped me improve the smoothness and power of my swing. Insider Tip Record your backswing with a smartphone. Watching yourself can reveal inconsistencies in your motion that you cant feel. Real-Life Example Overcoming a Slice with Proper Backswing Johns Struggle with a Slice Growing up, John always struggled with slicing the ball when he played golf. No matter how hard he tried, the ball always seemed to veer off course. Frustrated, he sought advice from a golf instructor who pointed out that his backswing was the root of the issue. Applying Proper Backswing Techniques John diligently worked on improving his backswing, focusing on keeping his hands in the correct position and maintaining a smooth motion. With practice, he started to notice a significant difference in the trajectory of his shots. The ball flew straighter and farther, giving John the confidence he needed to enjoy the game even more. The Impact of a Correct Backswing By mastering the backswing technique, John was able to overcome his slice and improve his overall golf game. He learned firsthand the importance of proper backswing mechanics and how it can make a world of difference in the outcome of each shot. 4. The Downswing The downswing is where the magic happens, where power is transferred to the ball. The key here is sequencing the hips lead, then the torso, followed by the arms, and finally, the club. Getting this sequence right ensures maximum power and accuracy. I learned the hard way that trying to start the downswing with my arms led to slices and inconsistent contact. Focusing on starting with my hips improved my ball striking significantly. Insider Tip Use a drill that emphasizes hip movement at the start of the downswing. This can help ingrain the proper sequence. 5. The Follow-Through The follow-through is often seen as just a formality, but its actually a good indicator of the quality of your swing. A balanced, controlled follow-through suggests a swing that was equally balanced and controlled. Your body should be facing the target, with your weight shifted onto your front foot. Working on my follow-through helped me understand the concept of swinging through the ball, not just to it, which made my shots more powerful and accurate. Insider Tip Focus on finishing with your chest facing the target and your back foot on its toes. This ensures a complete weight transfer. 6. The Finish A graceful finish is the hallmark of a good golf swing. It indicates that youve maintained balance and control throughout the swing.

The concepts presented by your coach or fitness trainer might be verbal or demonstrable, but how do you apply these changes in movement and position to your actual golf swing?

PGA Professional Brian Newman of Orange Whip Golf Fitness X, shares three very beneficial drills below that will have a huge impact on your golf swing — not through intense repetition on the range, but through a focus on your body.

Drill 1: Feet Together — L to L Swings (5-10 reps)

What to do:

With the feet together, make a three-quarter backswing and follow-through, continuously swinging back and forth without stopping. On the backswing, get the lead arm and the club’s shaft to create the letter “L” when the lead arm is parallel to the ground. On the forward swing, create an “L” with the trail arm and the club’s shaft when the trail arm is parallel to the ground. When creating the “L” position on both sides of the swing, attempt to get the butt of the club to point toward the ground on an extended line of the ball. Hit the ground at the same spot during the forward swing as you do when returning to the backswing. Be sure to shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot (downswing) and vice versa during the backswing.

Drill benefits:

Creates a consistent low point of the swing and keeps the player balanced

Syncs the arms and body and trains the proper levers and wrist hinge

Enhances rhythm, tempo and balance

Can be done with or without a golf ball

Great progression to teach rotation and weight shift

Improves core, hip and leg strength, as well as stability, flexibility and mobility

Suitable for all skill levels

Drill 2: Elbow Block Drill (5-10 reps)

What to do:

Block the trail elbow by reaching the lead arm across the body and position the back of the lead hand behind the elbow. On the backswing, maintain the lead hand’s “blocked” position behind your trail elbow. Rotate the trail arm externally through the shoulder to point the elbow toward the ground at the top of your swing. Begin the downswing and, while still blocking the trail elbow, allow the trail elbow to lead the downswing, pointing toward the ground as the body begins to rotate. Swing to a full finish, maintaining the elbow block. Repeat this for the lead arm, blocking the elbow with the back of the trail hand.

Drill benefits:

Helps create and maintain space between the arms and body

Fixes arm, hand and swing path and trains a powerful release

Forces proper trail arm and lead arm delivery of the club

Ensures the body is practicing efficient posture, rotation and weight shift

Creates immediate feedback when hitting balls

Increases leg, arm and hand speed

Can be performed with or without a ball

Improves mobility of the trail and lead arm

Trains arms independently

Drill 3: Rev-Up Swings (3-5 reps)

What to do:

Assume your set-up. Extend the arms and club towards the target, keeping the trail shoulder pointing towards the ground, the hips and chest open to the target, with air under the trail heel. Initiate a backswing with the lower body and allow the arms and club to follow, giving the lower body a head start. As the club is swinging back during the backswing, allow for the hips to initiate the downswing’s weight shift and turn, creating separation between the lower and upper body segments with body and club shaft lag. Note: Do not pause at the top of the swing. Allow the hips to fire while the upper body and club are approaching the top, creating the “Rev-Up” feel.

Drill benefits:

Increases swing speed and power instantly

Improves weight during both the backswing and forward swing

Trains a proper and powerful transition

Can be done with or without the ball

Creates natural feel of the takeaway and creates momentum into the downswing

Assists with hand and arm positioning

Teaches upper body and lower body separation

Whether you’re aiming to be the next big thing at the National Golf Club of Louisiana or simply looking to shave a few strokes off your game, integrating these 10 drills into your practice routine can transform your play. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill exercises; they’re tailored to refine your skills, focusing on precision, consistency, and the all-important mental aspect of golf. Alongside, I’ll share insights into shot shapes and trajectories that are game-changers. Let’s get started.

Improve Your Golf Game with These Drills Learn 10 effective golf drills for improving your game at the National Golf Club of Louisiana.

The drills include 3-6-9 Putting, Ladder, Tee, Clock, Box, Gate, Circle, Coin, Line, and Two-Tee drills.

Find out answers to FAQs about the best golf drills, improving your swing at home, beginner-friendly drills, and effective golf practice techniques.

1. The 3-6-9 Putting Drill

Putting is an art, and the 3-6-9 Drill is your canvas. Set up three markers at 3, 6, and 9 feet from the hole. Challenge yourself to make a certain number of putts in a row from each distance. This drill isnt just about honing your accuracy; its about building pressure-handling skills. Remember, confidence on the green translates to strokes saved.

2. The Ladder Drill

Distance control with your irons is non-negotiable. The Ladder Drill involves hitting balls to various distances with the same club, focusing on controlling your swing length and speed. It’s a phenomenal way to understand your clubs better and master the art of precision.

3. The Tee Drill

A simple yet effective drill for improving your swing path and eliminating slices or hooks. Place a tee on either side of your golf ball, narrowly spaced. The objective is to hit the ball without disturbing the tees, promoting a straighter, more controlled shot.

4. The Clock Drill

Putting again, because let’s face it, it’s where games are won or lost. The Clock Drill involves placing balls around the hole at equal distances, resembling the numbers on a clock. This not only improves your putting from various angles but enhances your ability to read greens.

5. The Box Drill

Intended to perfect your chipping, the Box Drill involves chipping balls into a designated box from various distances. Its crucial for touch and feel around the greens, turning potential bogeys into pars or even birdies.

6. The Gate Drill

For fine-tuning your putting stroke, the Gate Drill involves creating a “gate” with two objects just wider than your putter head. Stroke through the gate to ensure a straight-back, straight-through movement. Consistency is key.

Personal Experience: The Ladder Drill

I used to struggle with my short game, especially with hitting the ball the right distance. After trying various drills, I came across the ladder drill, which completely transformed my approach.

Rachel’s Story

Women playing at the National Golf Club of Louisiana

During practice, I set up 6 balls at increasing distances, starting from 10 feet and ending at 60 feet from the hole. The goal was to sink all 6 putts in a row. This drill not only improved my distance control but also boosted my confidence on the greens. I found that it translated into better performance during my actual rounds, and I was able to lower my overall score as a result. The ladder drill has become a staple in my practice routine, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their putting game.

7. The Circle Drill

Another putting drill, the Circle Drill emphasizes short, challenging putts. Place balls in a circle around the hole at a set distance. Rotate around, sinking each putt. It’s perfect for building confidence under pressure.

8. The Coin Drill

A hidden gem for improving your ball-striking. Place a coin slightly behind the ball. The goal is to strike the ball first, then the coin, promoting a descending blow which is crucial for solid, consistent contact.

9. The Line Drill

Alignment is often the culprit for errant shots. Lay a club or alignment stick on the ground, pointing towards your target. Practice your swings ensuring your feet, hips, and shoulders are parallel to the line. Its simple but remarkably effective.

10. The Two-Tee Drill

Designed to refine your driver swing, the Two-Tee Drill involves placing two tees on the ground, forming a gate just wider than your drivers head. The objective is to swing through the gate without hitting the tees, promoting a straighter path and reducing the risk of slices.

https://www.golfmonthly.com/tips/10-best-golf-drills-ever-195681,10 Best Golf Drills Ever – Recommended By A Top PGA Pro,"Every player should implement the best golf drills into their practice sessions, as they have the potential to supercharge your progress on the course.

Whether you are looking to achieve a centred strike with your driver, find the right ball position with hybrids or learn how to compress the golf ball with a better impact position, this article has something for you.

While there isn't necessarily a one size fits all approach to fixing the most common swing faults, I am going to use my extensive knowledge and years of experience as a PGA professional to help you play better golf...

1. Best Golf Drills: Ball-Striking

Nothing beats striking the ball well, out of the middle of the clubface, but sometimes it can be hard to know how close we are to 'middling' it. To get a better understanding, try spraying dry shampoo on the face of the club.

After you have hit the ball, the instant feedback provided by the mark left on the face will tell you everything you need to know. This is a great way to identify your focus moving forwards, whether that be learning how to stop toe strikes or getting a better understanding of golf shank causes.

2. Slice Fix

Golfers who struggle with a slice could ease their woes with the help of a simple training aid... a swimming noodle. This relatively cheap tool can help you to understand the swing path you are trying to achieve, and provide visual feedback instantly.

Place the noodle on the floor in a position that mirrors the semi-circular movement of the golf swing (see image below), and take some slow practice swings.

Feel how you move back in a circle. At the bottom, the club is moving down and coming through impact, before going on around in that circle to the finish.

Using this drill should improve your directional control, get your clubface more towards target and start to produce more solid strikes.

Setting up a swimming noodle as above will help you hone a better club path (Image credit: Tom Miles)

3. Rhythm

Often, golfers think that swinging the club too fast is the reason their rhythm is out of whack, when in fact it's more to do with the order in which they change direction.

Ideally, we want a smooth rotation of the body, almost setting the club at the top of the backswing and adopting a rhythmical change of direction.

When you are ready in your address position, make a good 90 degree should turn with your left shoulder pointing downwards to the ball.

Take the club to the top of the backswing and smoothly rotate your lower body to initiate the downswing.

The lead hip and leg rotate to initiate this, so get used to the feeling that creates as this will help to generate a great downswing sequence.

Set the club at the top then work on transitioning smoothly into the downswing (Image credit: Tom Miles)

4. Bunker Drill

This essential bunker drill will help you to understand how to get the ball out of the trap first time and how the club interacts with the sand.

Having a visual reference will help here, so draw a small rectangle in the sand around your golf ball. The idea is to remove all of the sand from inside your rectangle, with a clear entry point behind that ball.

Set-up with the ball a fraction ahead of centre, with slightly more weight on your front foot. Open the clubface, as this will allow you to start using the sole of the club more efficiently and will prevent the leading edge digging into the sand.

Take a swing and let your trail hand work down and underneath, throwing the sand nice and high towards the target.

Drawing a box around the ball and aim to remove the sand within is a great way to improve your bunker play (Image credit: Tom Miles)

5. Strike The Match

You won't get the desired result with your long-irons without the correct speed through impact. But it's not all about swinging as fast as you can.

Learning how to compress the golf ball is far more important. As the club comes into impact, imagine yourself striking a match, imagine that same sound.

A sharp sound through impact means you've generated good speed, and crucially, at the right moment. This will help you improve launch, control and distance you hit your irons.

Imagine you're trying to light a match when hitting your irons (Image credit: Tom Miles)

6. Tee Peg Drill

The is a difference between pitching and chipping, so before working on your short game, it pays to improve your understanding.

Designed to help your pitching, this drill is especially useful in getting rid of that nasty habit where the leading edge of the club digs down too much, one reason for those dreaded duff shots.

Instead, tee the ball up, take your normal set-up position and rehearse a few swings, visualising just clipping the ball up and away off the tee.

A shallower angle of attack will allow the sole of the club and the bounce angle to do the work. Breaking the tee is a no-no, as this means that the leading edge on your club is digging down.

This drill will help you shallow out your strike when chipping (Image credit: Tom Miles)

7. Hybrid Drill

Even though the best golf hybrids are designed to be easy to hit, there’s a tendency for club golfers to get too shallow. In fact, you need more of a downward impact, which is where this drill will help.

Place a coin two or three inches in front of the ball and play your shot as you would do normally. If you miss the coin, it’s because the sole of the club is travelling upwards too soon – the likely result is a thin contact.

You want to hit the coin, as this tells you that you have the correct downward angle of attack. This will lead to purer and more consistent strikes, which is going to give you added distance too.

Placing a coin in front of the ball and trying to remove it after impact will improve the quality of your strikes (Image credit: Tom Miles)

8. Putting Technique Drill

You could be the best player in the world at reading greens, but if you don’t start the ball on the right lines, the putts simply won’t drop.

This is why clubface alignment at impact is so crucial. In a bid to improve in this area, many people turn to their putting technique, but the answer is often much simpler.

The task here is clear: hit the ball along the metre rule into the hole.

This is one of my favourite putting drills that will help you to square the clubface at impact on a more consistent basis, while giving you visual feedback as to whether you’re pushing putts by opening the face, or pulling them by closing it.

In both cases, the ball will roll off the metre rule. If your speed is right, you’ll find the bottom of the cup.

Trying to hit a putt along a metre rule will enable you to control the putter face more (Image credit: Tom Miles)

9. Club Face Control

You can practise this at home to improve your awareness of how the clubface is affected by the way you hold the club. Attach a pencil to the centre of your clubface with Blu Tack, as shown.

At address, the pencil should cover the alignment stick. From here, you’ll get an understanding of where your clubface is during the backswing and whether you tend to open it (pencil up), close it (pencil down) or keep it fairly neutral (pencil straight).

A strong golf grip with lots of knuckles showing on the top hand will encourage more of a closed clubface when you take the club back; a weak golf grip will see the pencil pointing more towards the sky.

Work on presenting the club back to target without any twisting or manipulation.

This visual aid will give you instant feedback on your clubface alignment (Image credit: Tom Miles)

10. Topping Fix

Topping often comes as a result of trying to hit up on the ball. It’s a common fault in which you see the elbows separating and the wrists then acting to save the shot.

If you're guilty of this and want a drill on how to stop topping the golf ball, you've come to the right place. First, apply the resistance band as shown.

What I’m having to do is fight the resistance pulling my arms back towards my body. It helps you get used to the feeling of your arms extending as you go out and down towards the ball.

After a few swings, remove the band and you should find it’s far easier to get your arms extended.

Brush the ground with the sole and get that ‘whoosh’ sound. This will tell you that you’re extending your arms more and your chances of topping the ball will be greatly reduced.

Using a resistance band like this will help you stop topping the ball for good (Image credit: Tom Miles)","['Ged Walters', 'Top Coach', 'Social Links Navigation']",2020-04-17 12:53:01+00:00,www.golfmonthly.com,"Every player should implement the best golf drills into their practice sessions, as they have the potential to supercharge your progress on the course.

Designed to help your pitching, this drill is especially useful in getting rid of that nasty habit where the leading edge of the club digs down too much, one reason for those dreaded duff shots. Instead, tee the ball up, take your normal set-up position and rehearse a few swings, visualising just clipping the ball up and away off the tee. A shallower angle of attack will allow the sole of the club and the bounce angle to do the work. Breaking the tee is a no-no, as this means that the leading edge on your club is digging down. This drill will help you shallow out your strike when chipping Image credit Tom Miles 7. Hybrid Drill Even though the best golf hybrids are designed to be easy to hit, theres a tendency for club golfers to get too shallow. In fact, you need more of a downward impact, which is where this drill will help. Place a coin two or three inches in front of the ball and play your shot as you would do normally. If you miss the coin, its because the sole of the club is travelling upwards too soon  the likely result is a thin contact. You want to hit the coin, as this tells you that you have the correct downward angle of attack. This will lead to purer and more consistent strikes, which is going to give you added distance too. Placing a coin in front of the ball and trying to remove it after impact will improve the quality of your strikes Image credit Tom Miles 8. Putting Technique Drill You could be the best player in the world at reading greens, but if you dont start the ball on the right lines, the putts simply wont drop. This is why clubface alignment at impact is so crucial. In a bid to improve in this area, many people turn to their putting technique, but the answer is often much simpler. The task here is clear hit the ball along the metre rule into the hole. This is one of my favourite putting drills that will help you to square the clubface at impact on a more consistent basis, while giving you visual feedback as to whether youre pushing putts by opening the face, or pulling them by closing it. In both cases, the ball will roll off the metre rule. If your speed is right, youll find the bottom of the cup. Trying to hit a putt along a metre rule will enable you to control the putter face more Image credit Tom Miles 9. Club Face Control You can practise this at home to improve your awareness of how the clubface is affected by the way you hold the club. Attach a pencil to the centre of your clubface with Blu Tack, as shown. At address, the pencil should cover the alignment stick. From here, youll get an understanding of where your clubface is during the backswing and whether you tend to open it pencil up, close it pencil down or keep it fairly neutral pencil straight. A strong golf grip with lots of knuckles showing on the top hand will encourage more of a closed clubface when you take the club back a weak golf grip will see the pencil pointing more towards the sky. Work on presenting the club back to target without any twisting or manipulation. This visual aid will give you instant feedback on your clubface alignment Image credit Tom Miles 10. Topping Fix Topping often comes as a result of trying to hit up on the ball. Its a common fault in which you see the elbows separating and the wrists then acting to save the shot. If youre guilty of this and want a drill on how to stop topping the golf ball, youve come to the right place. First, apply the resistance band as shown. What Im having to do is fight the resistance pulling my arms back towards my body. It helps you get used to the feeling of your arms extending as you go out and down towards the ball. After a few swings, remove the band and you should find its far easier to get your arms extended. Brush the ground with the sole and get that whoosh sound. This will tell you that youre extending your arms more and your chances of topping the ball will be greatly reduced. Using a resistance band like this will help you stop topping the ball for good Image credit Tom Miles","['Every player should implement the best golf drills into their practice sessions, as they have the potential to supercharge your progress on the course. Whether you are looking to achieve a centred strike with your driver, find the right ball position with hybrids or learn how to compress the golf ball with a better impact position, this article has something for you. While there isnt necessarily a one size fits all approach to fixing the most common swing faults, I am going to use my extensive knowledge and years of experience as a PGA professional to help you play better golf... 1. Best Golf Drills Ball-Striking Nothing beats striking the ball well, out of the middle of the clubface, but sometimes it can be hard to know how close we are to middling it. To get a better understanding, try spraying dry shampoo on the face of the club. After you have hit the ball, the instant feedback provided by the mark left on the face will tell you everything you need to know. This is a great way to identify your focus moving forwards, whether that be learning how to stop toe strikes or getting a better understanding of golf shank causes. Spraying the clubface with dry shampoo will help golfers identify their tendencies and try to address them Image credit Tom Miles 2. Slice Fix Golfers who struggle with a slice could ease their woes with the help of a simple training aid... a swimming noodle. This relatively cheap tool can help you to understand the swing path you are trying to achieve, and provide visual feedback instantly. Place the noodle on the floor in a position that mirrors the semi-circular movement of the golf swing see image below, and take some slow practice swings.

At the bottom, the club is moving down and coming through impact, before going on around in that circle to the finish. Using this drill should improve your directional control, get your clubface more towards target and start to produce more solid strikes. Setting up a swimming noodle as above will help you hone a better club path Image credit Tom Miles 3. Rhythm Often, golfers think that swinging the club too fast is the reason their rhythm is out of whack, when in fact its more to do with the order in which they change direction. Ideally, we want a smooth rotation of the body, almost setting the club at the top of the backswing and adopting a rhythmical change of direction. When you are ready in your address position, make a good 90 degree should turn with your left shoulder pointing downwards to the ball. Take the club to the top of the backswing and smoothly rotate your lower body to initiate the downswing. The lead hip and leg rotate to initiate this, so get used to the feeling that creates as this will help to generate a great downswing sequence. Set the club at the top then work on transitioning smoothly into the downswing Image credit Tom Miles 4. Bunker Drill This essential bunker drill will help you to understand how to get the ball out of the trap first time and how the club interacts with the sand. Having a visual reference will help here, so draw a small rectangle in the sand around your golf ball. The idea is to remove all of the sand from inside your rectangle, with a clear entry point behind that ball. Set-up with the ball a fraction ahead of centre, with slightly more weight on your front foot. Open the clubface, as this will allow you to start using the sole of the club more efficiently and will prevent the leading edge digging into the sand. Take a swing and let your trail hand work down and underneath, throwing the sand nice and high towards the target. Drawing a box around the ball and aim to remove the sand within is a great way to improve your bunker play Image credit Tom Miles 5. Strike The Match You wont get the desired result with your long-irons without the correct speed through impact. But its not all about swinging as fast as you can. Learning how to compress the golf ball is far more important. As the club comes into impact, imagine yourself striking a match, imagine that same sound. A sharp sound through impact means youve generated good speed, and crucially, at the right moment. This will help you improve launch, control and distance you hit your irons.

Have you ever been more frustrated than when you thought you pured a golf shot and it ended up missing your target by 20 yards? In most cases, you realize that you were miss-aligned.

However, it is common for one to misinterpret that result as a swing error rather than faulty alignment.

If I had to come up with a perfect guess I would say 8 out of every 10 students that come to my lesson tee are frustrated telling me that they cannot aim themselves correctly to their target to save their life.

This is obviously a huge problem as we all know golf is a game of misses.

Its hard enough to hit shots in the sweet spot.

Ben Hogan said he only hit the sweet spot 4 times per round.

We definitely dont want to see our good swings wasted because we were aimed at something other than the target. I read once that if you are aimed 5 degrees off-line, you can miss a shot by close to 20 yards! Holy cow! It goes without saying that it is no good having a perfect set up, perfect grip and perfect swing if the whole thing is miss-aligned.

It sounds obvious but many players simply do not spend enough time getting themselves on target. - Nick Faldo.

Why Are the Pros So Concerned with Alignment? Early on, when I competed in professional events or attended them as a spectator, I was always taken by the number of players who had clubs laid on the ground at the practice tee. I would routinely see their swing coaches behind them helping them tinker with the smallest details in the set up, particularly alignment.

Tour players are obsessive compulsive about alignment and thats putting it lightly.

For they know how easily shots can be wasted with miss-alignment, but also how it can adversely affect their golf swing. I often say lack of practice on alignment is what keeps me in business.

When players slowly get off on their aim it affects their swing causing compensations.

In an era where the big buzzword seems to be connected, its interesting how few golfers actually are. I dont mean on Facebook, Linkedin or Twitter, I mean to their golf club.

Rarely does a student come to the lesson tee where I dont have to make some sort of adjustment to his or her grip.

It is, in my opinion, the most difficult thing to get a golfer to change and to get a golfer accustomed to. I usually will start the lesson by saying, Its unfortunate, but we are going to have to change your grip.

We are going to do it first and get it out-of-the-way because it is going to make everything else you do feel awkward and you arent going to like me for a while.

It is sort of the standard reply I developed after years of having to overcome the resistance. I figured I might as well just tell them that it is going to be difficult up front.

People are very resistant to change in general and seem to be very in love with what actually doesnt work.

There are Three Standard Grips.

Feel like you are holding a baby bird.

Grip it and rip it! Are you kidding me? Wow! Could it get any more confusing? These are just two of the quotes about gripping the golf club that you often hear by well-meaning pros or those that think they are pros.

Not to mention there are 3 standard styles of gripping the club for the full swing that are taught throughout the world.

The Vardon grip or overlapping, the interlock and the 10 finger or baseball grip.

No wonder it is a major source of frustration for both students and teachers.

Establishing good posture and maintaining it throughout the swing is the key to golfing success on so many levels.

Among other things, posture affects your consistency, balance, swing plane and club head speed.

Ive seen countless numbers of students with their swing center moving all over the place, their head bobbing up and down and struggling to simply not fall over during their swings! With all of that going on it is impossible to achieve our ultimate goal which is to return the shaft on the same angle or plane as it was at set up.

Your Posture is the Foundation of Your Swing.

Just like the foundation for your house, your posture needs to be a stable base for your swing.

There is a lot going on in your swing.

You are turning or pivoting, shifting your weight and swinging a long shaft with a steel head at high speed.

Sound swings start with posture that enables all of this to happen while maintaining a constant swing center, balance and the ability to remain athletic and flexible.

When it comes to constant swing center and balance you need to establish a posture that will keep your center of gravity fairly low and prevent your pelvis from moving all over in space.

Often I hear players tell me they look up during their swing causing them to top the ball.

https://www.mygolfinstructor.com/instruction/diagnosing-problems/how-the-hips-work/,How The Hips Work,"The Mystery of the Hips.

Hips Opening Through Impact.

The middle section of the body provides for a lot of discussion in golf.

Although there are hoards of questions that students pose on the lesson tee, the topic of hips is one that always results in a fairly lengthy conversation.

There seems to be a lot of confusion between what a person feels and what they are actually doing with their hips.

If I posed the question Should your hips turn or slide in the golf swing? to 10 students in a day, Im likely to get 10 different answers.

This area of our body holds our organs, is the center of our chior life force from ancient arts and it is the key to power in our golf swing.

Keep Your Butt Back.

Our hips can provide either stability or instability and they are designed to rotate.

When we set the hips in a good position at address, they are more likely to stay there and provide a stable base throughout the swing.

This means we will be able to stay in balance while rotating the body with force and not torque our lower backs and end up with an injury.

When we start with the hips in a poor position or move them out of position as we swing, the entire golf swing becomes unbalanced, unstable, less powerful and we become more prone for injury.

What is a flip in the golf swing? The term flip refers to an incorrect cupping of the wrists through the impact zone.

If you take the back of your front hand and pull it up towards the back of your forearm you will see the backwards bend in your wrist that is referred to as cupping.

Ideally, we want the back of our front hand to stay flat or in line with our forearm and heres why.

When you release your wrists early and cup through impact a host of errors follow.

The most common are The clubhead hits the ground before the ball as a result of uncocking your wrists too early as you come into the ball.

This causes a fat shot.

The clubhead misses the ground because you uncock your wrists as you come into the ball, but it then comes up too quickly as you cup your wrists resulting in a skulled or thin shot.

As you cup your wrists you add unwanted loft resulting in a scoop and a much weaker shot with a noticeable loss of distance.

Basically you lose control and can hit a wide variety of ugly shots because as you flip the clubhead passes your hands.

Proper Balance Eliminates the Reverse Pivot.

There are 3 main reverse pivots in the golf swing.

To help understand what is meant by a reverse pivot, remember that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Your body wants to be in balance.

No one wants to fall over, so we are well equipped to subconsciously activate self balancing reactions when we sense our equilibrium is off.

This is what happens when you reverse pivot.

The term reverse here simply means you are doing things backwards or in reverse order.

When you reverse pivot in your golf swing your weight and body parts move in the opposite direction to which they are supposed to.

In other words, when your weight should move onto your back foot and then onto your front foot, with a reverse pivot it does the opposite.

Your weight will move towards your target onto your front foot and then it will fall away from the target onto your back foot.

When your weight is not moving correctly and with the force of your swing, you will lose a lot of power.

Having your weight reverse also leads to off plane swing conditions, loss of direction and inconsistent contact.

So not only will you hit the ball shorter, you will end up spraying it all over the place if your are not properly balanced with stacked body parts during the swing.

The 3 reverse pivots 1 Lower body reverse pivot on the takeaway.

Here, your hips and lower body move towards the target on the takeaway forcing your weight to lean onto your front foot.

As a result you will usually then rock onto your back side as you come into the ball. 2 Lower body reverse pivot on the down swing.

Here your hips and lower body move backwards and you fall back on your rear foot as you swing into the ball. 3 Hip slide  upper body reverse pivot on the back swing.

https://swingtrainer.com/blogs/instruction/golf-stance,Correct Golf Stance & Position Tips for All Clubs,"Proper Golf Stance

Most golfers understand how important a proper golf stance and alignment are, but many golfers don’t practice or work on this fundamental skill. If you want to improve, or just to enjoy the game more, it is important to get in the right golf position before you hit a shot. The good news is that every player regardless of their skill level can do it successfully. Learning the correct golf stance will make your swing better and help you to hit the ball farther and straighter.

Golf Stance Tips for Any Club

This article will help you to get into the proper golf stance for any club, and note the important differences in the golf stance between your driver and irons.



Golf Stance Tips for Any Club

Your golf stance is the foundation of your golf swing with every club in your bag. If you don’t set-up and aim properly you will not hit the ball at your target, and chances are you’ll lose distance and direction. A proper stance for each club will help you to generate a more powerful and accurate swing. So pay close attention to the checkpoints and special pro tips below to help you get into the correct golf position and golf stance and become a better, more consistent golfer.

Alignment

In a proper golf stance your clubface is pointed where you want the ball to go, commonly referred to as the target line. Since you stand to the side of the ball, your feet should be aligned parallel to your target line. For a right hand golfer, this means your feet are aimed just to the left of your target line. When you practice building your golf stance, it helps to use an alignment stick pointed down your target line. This allows you to aim your club face square to the target line and then build the alignment of your feet and body.



It is also helpful to have an alignment reference for your feet like the picture below.

Pro Tip: After you build the proper golf stance, rotate your head and look at your target to reinforce in your mind where you want to hit the ball. It is important to make sure that your feet, knees, hips, arms and shoulders are all aligned in the same direction. This is one of the hardest skills in golf to master and it helps to practice with a device like the Swing Align swing trainer to both see and feel a correct golf stance.

Width

For a full golf shot you should stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. Your stance will be the widest for a driver (with your feet just outside your shoulder width) and narrowest for a full wedge shot (with your feet just inside your shoulder width). Note that for most pitch and chip shots around the green your feet will be much closer together.

Ball Position

There are two different aspects to ball position. The first is where you position the ball front to back in your golf stance. The second is how far you position the ball away from your feet, or said another way how far away you stand from the ball.



For a driver, the ball should be positioned forward in your stance off the heel of your lead foot. For a wedge your ball should be positioned back almost to the middle of your stance. For the clubs in between, move the ball progressively back as the club gets shorter. That means for fairways, hybrid and long irons position the ball inside of your lead foot. Your mid irons (#’s 5,6,7) should be approximately halfway between the inside of your lead foot and the middle of your stance.

Pro Tip: If you struggle to progressively change your ball position for each club, you can play all your irons from a spot inside of your lead foot. Jack Nicklaus used this simplified approach with great success and was known for hitting beautiful, high flying, soft landing irons shots.



The distance you stand from the ball in a proper stance for golf is dictated by the length of the club you are hitting and your posture. The longer the club, the farther you stand away from the ball. It is important not to hunch over and reach out for the ball with your arms. Your arms should hang down naturally. In order to hit a good golf shot you need to be in a balanced athletic position. The next section covers posture which will help you with balance and ball position.

Posture

A good golf posture for full shots is achieved by bending over from the waist while keeping your spine straight (it is ok if your upper spine rounds a little). You must push your rear end out just past your heels and flex your knees as you bend over from the waist. If done correctly your arms will hang almost straight down from your chest and your hands will be under your chin.





Pro Tip: For an athletic set up, your weight should be balanced on the balls of your feet (with not too much weight in your heels or toes).

Spine Angle

Spine angle is important when viewed both from face on (for spine tilt) and down the line of your shot (for spine bend).



Viewed from face on, your spine angle should be tilted back, generally between 5-15 degrees depending on the club - more for your driver and less for your irons. Your shoulders should never be level when viewed face on with any club.

When looking at posture from behind the golfer, down the line of the target, the spine angle should be bent over at approximately 35-40 degrees. This will provide plenty of room for your shoulders to rotate down, in and around to help you take the club away on the proper plane.

Weight Distribution

Your weight should be balanced on the balls of your feet, not too much in the toes or too much in the heels. This will keep you in an athletic position and ready to move, coil and strike the ball.



For full shots, a proper golf stance will have your weight distributed 50/50 from front to back with half the weight on your lead leg and half on the trail leg. Some good players have slightly more weight on their lead leg for irons, but in general 50/50 is a good target.



A common fault to avoid is taking your golf stance with too much weight on your trail side or back foot. Many golfers lean back to help them shift their weight which typically leads to hanging back on the downswing instead of getting the weight to their lead side.

Arms and Hands

In a proper stance for golf, your arms hang down nearly straight from your chest while your hands are almost directly below your chin. When hitting a driver which is the longest club in your bag, it is ok to have your arms and hands a little farther out from your body. This gives you more room to fully rotate and swing the club freely. When hitting irons however, you should never feel like you are reaching out for the ball.



In terms of your arms and hands when viewed straight on, your lead arm should hang down so that your hands are positioned closer to your lead hip versus the middle. This generally works for both your driver and irons but keep in mind that your ball position changes for your driver versus irons.

For irons which are played with the ball more toward the middle of your stance, having your hands off your lead hip puts them in front of the ball which helps you hit down and create ball first contact before you hit the ground.

For the driver, your hands should be off your lead hip but remember the ball is positioned forward in your stance. That means your hands are just behind the golf ball helping you to hit up and launch the ball for more distance. This is a key difference between driver and irons worth remembering!



Pro Tip: When taking the proper golf stance for a driver you should have the ball positioned forward and your spine angle tilted back at a greater angle than your irons. This sets you up for a great impact position to hit up on the ball and launch it higher and with less spin (the keys to driver distance).

Golf Stance For Irons

Here is a summary of a proper golf stance for irons.



Narrower than a driver stance

Feet shoulder width apart to slightly less for a full wedge shot

Ball is positioned inside the lead foot to middle of the stance

Arms hang straight down

Hands a little closer to the body versus the driver stance

Hands off the lead hip in front of the ball

Spine tilts back but less than the driver stance

Weight 50/50 but ok if slightly more weight on the lead side

Stance & Position For Drivers

Here is a summary of a proper golf stance for drivers.



Wider than an iron stance

Feet shoulder width apart to slightly wider

Ball is positioned forward, out from the lead heel

Arms hang straight down to slightly out

Hands a little farther from the body versus an iron stance

Hands off the lead hip slightly behind the ball

Spine tilts back, more than with a golf iron stance

Weight 50/50

Final Pro Tip: One of the hardest things to do is consistently start your golf swing. As you first move the club be sure to turn your lead shoulder down, in and around your spine bend, while staying in your posture. Too many golfers stand up and straighten their spine and turn their shoulders flat and around leading to faults later in the swing including over the top and slicing. Use Swing Align with its highly visible alignment rod to help you see and feel the right moves at the start of your golf swing.

This is one of the most important things to playing good golf!","['Proper Golf Stance Most golfers understand how important a proper golf stance and alignment are, but many golfers dont practice or work on this fundamental skill. If you want to improve, or just to enjoy the game more, it is important to get in the right golf position before you hit a shot. The good news is that every player regardless of their skill level can do it successfully. Learning the correct golf stance will make your swing better and help you to hit the ball farther and straighter. Golf Stance Tips for Any Club This article will help you to get into the proper golf stance for any club, and note the important differences in the golf stance between your driver and irons. Golf Stance Tips for Any Club Your golf stance is the foundation of your golf swing with every club in your bag. If you dont set-up and aim properly you will not hit the ball at your target, and chances are youll lose distance and direction. A proper stance for each club will help you to generate a more powerful and accurate swing. So pay close attention to the checkpoints and special pro tips below to help you get into the correct golf position and golf stance and become a better, more consistent golfer. Alignment In a proper golf stance your clubface is pointed where you want the ball to go, commonly referred to as the target line. Since you stand to the side of the ball, your feet should be aligned parallel to your target line. For a right hand golfer, this means your feet are aimed just to the left of your target line. When you practice building your golf stance, it helps to use an alignment stick pointed down your target line. This allows you to aim your club face square to the target line and then build the alignment of your feet and body. It is also helpful to have an alignment reference for your feet like the picture below. Pro Tip After you build the proper golf stance, rotate your head and look at your target to reinforce in your mind where you want to hit the ball. It is important to make sure that your feet, knees, hips, arms and shoulders are all aligned in the same direction. This is one of the hardest skills in golf to master and it helps to practice with a device like the Swing Align swing trainer to both see and feel a correct golf stance. Width For a full golf shot you should stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. Your stance will be the widest for a driver with your feet just outside your shoulder width and narrowest for a full wedge shot with your feet just inside your shoulder width. Note that for most pitch and chip shots around the green your feet will be much closer together. Ball Position There are two different aspects to ball position. The first is where you position the ball front to back in your golf stance. The second is how far you position the ball away from your feet, or said another way how far away you stand from the ball. For a driver, the ball should be positioned forward in your stance off the heel of your lead foot. For a wedge your ball should be positioned back almost to the middle of your stance. For the clubs in between, move the ball progressively back as the club gets shorter. That means for fairways, hybrid and long irons position the ball inside of your lead foot. Your mid irons s 5,6,7 should be approximately halfway between the inside of your lead foot and the middle of your stance. Pro Tip If you struggle to progressively change your ball position for each club, you can play all your irons from a spot inside of your lead foot. Jack Nicklaus used this simplified approach with great success and was known for hitting beautiful, high flying, soft landing irons shots. The distance you stand from the ball in a proper stance for golf is dictated by the length of the club you are hitting and your posture. The longer the club, the farther you stand away from the ball. It is important not to hunch over and reach out for the ball with your arms. Your arms should hang down naturally. In order to hit a good golf shot you need to be in a balanced athletic position. The next section covers posture which will help you with balance and ball position. Posture A good golf posture for full shots is achieved by bending over from the waist while keeping your spine straight it is ok if your upper spine rounds a little. You must push your rear end out just past your heels and flex your knees as you bend over from the waist. If done correctly your arms will hang almost straight down from your chest and your hands will be under your chin. Pro Tip For an athletic set up, your weight should be balanced on the balls of your feet with not too much weight in your heels or toes. Spine Angle Spine angle is important when viewed both from face on for spine tilt and down the line of your shot for spine bend. Viewed from face on, your spine angle should be tilted back, generally between 5-15 degrees depending on the club - more for your driver and less for your irons. Your shoulders should never be level when viewed face on with any club. When looking at posture from behind the golfer, down the line of the target, the spine angle should be bent over at approximately 35-40 degrees. This will provide plenty of room for your shoulders to rotate down, in and around to help you take the club away on the proper plane. Weight Distribution Your weight should be balanced on the balls of your feet,', 'push your rear end out just past your heels and flex your knees as you bend over from the waist.

When looking at posture from behind the golfer, down the line of the target, the spine angle should be bent over at approximately 35-40 degrees. This will provide plenty of room for your shoulders to rotate down, in and around to help you take the club away on the proper plane. Weight Distribution Your weight should be balanced on the balls of your feet, not too much in the toes or too much in the heels. This will keep you in an athletic position and ready to move, coil and strike the ball. For full shots, a proper golf stance will have your weight distributed 5050 from front to back with half the weight on your lead leg and half on the trail leg. Some good players have slightly more weight on their lead leg for irons, but in general 5050 is a good target. A common fault to avoid is taking your golf stance with too much weight on your trail side or back foot. Many golfers lean back to help them shift their weight which typically leads to hanging back on the downswing instead of getting the weight to their lead side. Arms and Hands In a proper stance for golf, your arms hang down nearly straight from your chest while your hands are almost directly below your chin. When hitting a driver which is the longest club in your bag, it is ok to have your arms and hands a little farther out from your body. This gives you more room to fully rotate and swing the club freely. When hitting irons however, you should never feel like you are reaching out for the ball. In terms of your arms and hands when viewed straight on, your lead arm should hang down so that your hands are positioned closer to your lead hip versus the middle. This generally works for both your driver and irons but keep in mind that your ball position changes for your driver versus irons. For irons which are played with the ball more toward the middle of your stance, having your hands off your lead hip puts them in front of the ball which helps you hit down and create ball first contact before you hit the ground. For the driver, your hands should be off your lead hip but remember the ball is positioned forward in your stance. That means your hands are just behind the golf ball helping you to hit up and launch the ball for more distance. This is a key difference between driver and irons worth remembering! Pro Tip When taking the proper golf stance for a driver you should have the ball positioned forward and your spine angle tilted back at a greater angle than your irons. This sets you up for a great impact position to hit up on the ball and launch it higher and with less spin the keys to driver distance. Golf Stance For Irons Here is a summary of a proper golf stance for irons.

Our ultimate guide will show you the proper golf ball position by club, and ensure you’re set up for success before your first golf swing.

Ball Position vs. Foot Position in Golf: What Are The Differences?

Many golfers need clarification on ball position and foot position. Ball position is the location of the ball between your feet. Foot position can include the width of the stance and the angle at which your feet turn.

To hit great golf shots, you will need to consider both ball position and foot position.

Changing your ball position won’t impact your foot position. However, if you adjust your foot position, it may modify the location of the ball.

Golf Ball Position By Club

There are two critical things you should know about golf ball position.

The ball position will change depending on the club that you have in your hand. All ball position adjustments are subtle; major changes from one club to the next can create too much inconsistency in your game.

The driver is the club that will be furthest forward, and the wedges more toward the center/back of the stance. Correct ball position will impact your accuracy, distance, and trajectory, so pay close attention and get these positions down.

Golf Club Ball Position Driver Just inside the front heel Fairway Woods A ball’s width inside the front heel Hybrids A ball’s width inside the front heel Long Irons (2, 3, 4) Center to slightly forward Mid Irons (5, 6, 7) Center Short Irons (8, 9) Center Wedges Center to slightly back Putter Slightly forward of center

Ball Position By Club Complete Breakdown

If your ball position isn’t accurately set up for the swing, you’re at risk to lose distance, accuracy, and more. Let’s break down each club in your bag and discuss the proper ball position and why it makes all the difference.

Driver

Ball Position: Just inside the front heel

The driver is the furthest up you will place a golf ball in your stance. Placing the driver too far back can cause a low shot that hooks. The opposite occurs if you place the ball too far forward.

Some players exaggerate the position of the ball with their driver, and this is where you see a lot of the pop-up type shots. If you want optimal distance in your drive, it needs to stay in the air for a while, and you must catch it as part of your upswing.

The inside front heel position is perfect for this.

Fairway Woods

Ball Position: A ball’s width inside front heel

The biggest mistake amateur players make with the fairway woods is to place the golf ball in the same position as the driver when using the fairway wood. If you don’t move the ball back slightly, chances are you will have difficulty with consistency in your shots. The most common issues are topping or hitting the ball fat.

Hybrids

Ball Position: A ball’s width inside the front heel

Hybrids are tricky because they are meant to be played like an iron. However, if you play them as far back as an iron, you may hit the shot fat. Instead, keep the position close to that of a fairway wood, even if it’s just slightly back from the fairway wood position.

Hybrids are built for distance and accuracy, and this ball position will guarantee that.

Long Irons (2, 3, 4)

Ball Position: Center to slightly forward

Many amateur players have moved from long irons to hybrids. Long irons are designed for extra distance; if you play them too far back in your stance, you’ll lose this extra distance. Too far forward, and the ball will likely go too high and lose power.

Long irons take precision to hit well. Make sure that the ball position is accurate and consistent if you want to give yourself a chance.

Mid Irons (5, 6, 7)

Ball Position: Center

The ball position for the mid-irons is the easiest to figure out. Play this shot right from the middle of your stance. With center ball position, you’ll find you have more precision and control. In addition, it’s easier to maintain balance and consistency.

Short Irons (8, 9)

Ball Position: Center

There is a lot of talk among golfers about putting the golf ball further back in the stance when hitting short irons. This isn’t necessary. You still want to ensure you get proper ball flight and distance from your 8 and 9 irons.

Instead, put the ball in the center; your stance can be slightly narrower, but you still want to get the most out of these clubs. The biggest issue you will find with incorrect ball position in the short irons is control of the trajectory.

Your shots will fly too high and come up short or fly too low with not enough spin to stop where you want them.

Wedges

Ball Position: Center to one ball back

Depending on the type of wedge shot you are hitting, the ball can be placed anywhere from center to slightly back of center. Getting the ball position right for your wedge shots will help to increase precision, accuracy, and spin.

Remember that your feet should also be closer together when hitting wedge shots, so that can change your visual of where the ball is located.

If you are hitting a high lofted wedge shot with an open stance, the ball may feel further back in your stance.

Putter

Ball Position: Slightly forward of center

Putting is all about the details. If your ball position is even just slightly off, your chance of getting the ball in the hole is significantly reduced. Improper ball position can affect the roll and the direction of the putt.

The best place to put a ball with your putter is just forward of center.

With this position, you can hit the putt as part of your upswing and maintain a smoother and straighter path.

How to Master Ball Position

Head out to the range and bring some alignment sticks with you. Check the ball position of your shots and see if you are in the right place. Chances are you have an issue somewhere that can be easily adjusted. Ball position is a great problem to have in your golf game because it’s always a quick fix.

https://www.golfdistillery.com/swing-tips/setup-address/spine/,How Should you Set your Spine at Address in Golf,"at Address

Your spine will be set at address along three different ways. Firstly by the way you tilt your upper body forward. Secondly by the actual shape of your spine as it runs from your hips to your neck. And finally by the side angle it will assume to account for one hand being lower than the other.

Tilt your Upper Body Forward for the Right Spine Angle

Closely related to how much flex you are setting in your knees at address is the angle that will be found in your spine. Indeed, flexing your knees a lot will likely require that you bend your upper body forward quite a lot as well. Conversely, those who don’t bend their knees much will likely complete a standing tall position through bending their upper body forward just a little. As with the knee bend, the objective here is to find the middle ground.

Reduced Forward Bend

A golfer who is said to be standing tall at address will have a reduced forward bend in contrast to an average one. Indeed, in that posture the angle between the upper legs and the trunk of the upper body will be larger.

Notably, this posture was recommended by Ben Hogan who advised golfers to feel as though they are sitting on a stool that is planted in the ground. The upper body remains quite upright and the knees are generally bent only slightly.

Severe Forward Bend

A golfer with a too pronounced forward bend will look like he is reaching out and down towards the ball at address.

Indeed, in that posture the angle between the upper legs and the trunk of the upper body will be smaller, indicative that the two are close to one another. The golfer in such a position will be lower and closer to the ground than with any of the other types of spine bends.

Adopting such a stance may prove to add muscle tension in your lower back and do so unnecessarily.

Normal Forward Bend

A normal – or average – forward bend would be one that allows you to position your club behind the ball at address comfortably using both the flex in your knees and the forward tilt of your upper body.

Such a position stacks your body weight along a central axis that runs down to the middle of your feet while allowing you to feel very stable on your feet.

This position should be very comfortable and induce no muscle tension and is generally recommended as the default position for a golf swing.

Setting the Correct Spine Pattern

Now that the spine angle has been set, it is now time to make sure the spine pattern is also optimal.

There are three main patterns available in the C-Shape, the S-Shape and finally the Straight Line. Only the latter is optimal as it provides the ideal position that allows you to comfortably rotate along your axis.

“C” Spine Pattern

A “C” curve pattern is one where the tailbone lines up with the middle of your back in a letter C shape. This is obtained by rounding out your back in an exaggerated fashion or through no effort at all in keeping your back straight. Indeed, the golfer with that spine shape will simply position himself in front of the ball and will rest the club down on the ground solely through lowering his shoulders.

Again, this type of back tilt will make it harder for you to rotate properly during the golf swing. And again, it might lead to golfers standing up at address. As with the case for the S pattern above, most of the weight will be supported by the lower back, which will likely lead to lower back pain. This is in contrast to a neutral spine shape which will direct most of the weight of the upper body towards the hips rather than the back.

“S” Spine Pattern

An “S” curve pattern is one where the tailbone lines up with the middle of your back in a letter S shape. This is obtained by sticking your buttocks outward and up in an exaggerated fashion while keeping your upper body in a standing tall fashion. The combination of the two positions creates a depression around the lower back.

This type of back tilt is known to hinder proper rotation and more troublesome still it places most of the upper body’s weight on the lower back instead of on the hips. This can lead to lower back pain and can lead to golfers standing up during the rotation in order to relieve that pain.

Straight Spine Pattern

A neutral spine curve pattern is one where the tailbone lines up with the middle of the back in a straight line. The middle of the back refers here to the portion in between your shoulder blades.

Also known as a straight back, this pattern essentially has no curve pattern at all. It allows for excellent upper body rotation and places most of the weight at the hips.

Setting your Shoulders the Right Way

Finally, your spine angle is adjustable in a third way. Indeed, on top of the spine forward and shape pattern possibilities, your spine will also be tilted sideways a little. This third set of options is visible through the way your shoulders are aligned, or more precisely the height of one relative to the other.

Level Shoulders

Golfers who do not pay attention to the way their hands are positioned on the club won’t notice that one is lower to the ground than the other. They will therefore assume that both shoulders should be level with one another and on a line that is parallel to the ground.

Setting up this way will twist the spine near the shoulders and will make it difficult to swing properly.

It should be noted that this setup can be useful in some instances as it promotes hitting down on the ball. It could therefore be used for delicate shots that do not require a full swing. But it should be avoided for drives as the club is meant to be hitting the ball on the way up.

Back Shoulder Drops Too Low

On the opposite end of the scale, those who are indeed aware of the right hand being lower than the left may overshoot that slight difference.

This results in the right shoulder dropping too low relative to the left, which makes hitting down on the ball close to impossible.

These golfers may have been taught to position themselves in such a way whenever hitting drives, which are indeed made to be hit when the club is rising and which this setup promotes. However, it becomes risky to overdo as this setup can creep into regular iron and wedge play where fat shots can occur as a result.

Just Right

An ideal spinal side tilt will be one that naturally follows how your hands are positioned on the club.

Indeed, because your right hand will be positioned lower on the grip than the left at address, it is natural that your right shoulder should stand lower and closer to the ground.

Failure to do this will result in your spine being crooked, as is the case with the two errors above.

Secondly by the actual shape of your spine as it runs from your hips to your neck. And finally by the side angle it will assume to account for one hand being lower than the other. Tilt your Upper Body Forward for the Right Spine Angle Closely related to how much flex you are setting in your knees at address is the angle that will be found in your spine.

Setting up to the ball with the correct posture is something that all golfers are capable of doing and is the first step in making a good golf swing. Ever wonder how the pros make what looks like an effortless turn leading to a swing that is both powerful and accurate? Having the correct golf posture and maintaining their spine angle is how!

Correct Spine Tilt

For a right handed golfer, when you grip the golf club at set-up your right hand goes below your left. This means your spine should be tilted slightly back to the right allowing you to easily reach your right hand onto the club without bending. The proper spine tilt angles your front shoulder slightly up, and your trailing shoulder slightly down. This slight spine tilt puts your body in the ideal position to turn away from the ball without collapsing forward or sliding away from the ball. If done correctly the proper spine tilt feels like your sternum is angled at your front knee.

An easy drill to do with Swing Align to check your spine tilt is to check the angle of the alignment rod across your chest. At address the alignment rod should be square to your target line and angled slightly up. This position is the beginning of a successful golf swing!

Incorrect Spine Tilt

If your shoulders are too level at address it means your front side is slightly collapsed and your weight is probably distributed too much on your front foot. When your front side is collapsed, or your weight is too far forward, it is easy to start the golf swing by taking the club away too far outside, or too steep, both of which cause multiple swing issues typically resulting is a slice, poor contact, and loss of power.

Correct Spine Angle

Your spine angle and your body’s forward bend towards the golf ball at set-up is critical to hitting solid golf shots. In order to achieve the correct spine angle, set your feet about shoulder-width apart for an iron shot, slightly wider for a driver. Bend your upper body forward from the hips and push your behind back. Your lower back should remain as flat as possible and your tailbone should feel like it is pushed back. Keep your weight centered in the middle of your feet, not back in your heels or out on your toes. You should feel like the back of your shoulders, knees and feet, and where your shoelaces end are lined up vertically. Your knees will be bent slightly forward.

Incorrect Spine Angle

Many golfers don’t bend forward at the hips but they round forward in the shoulders to reach the ball. This makes it very difficult to rotate your shoulders and hips. Many golfers don’t bend their upper body forward enough keeping their spine too vertical, having to bend their knees too much and reach their arms out to get to the ball. Either way this causes you to start the backswing with your arms lifting the club to the top instead of turning. When you start with the arms you typically swing down with the arms, often resulting in a pull, or a pull slice.

How To Maintain Your Spine Angle

A good drill for maintaining your spine angle is to practice your takeaway and concentrate on immediately moving your front shoulder down instead lifting your arms up or moving your shoulders out and around. After getting in the right set up position, with your spine angled forward by bending at the hips, turn the club back using both your shoulders and hips, not your arms. When your club reaches horizontal, the face of your club should be parallel to your spine angle. From here you are in a great position to maintain your spine angle to the top of your swing.

Benefits of the Correct Golf Posture

Having the proper spine tilt, spine angle and golf posture is essential for a good golf swing. There are so many benefits it is well worth it to work with a trained golf instructor, or with a golf plane trainer like Swing Align, to learn the proper set-up and golf posture and to continue practicing until it becomes ingrained in your muscle memory!

Like the starting movement almost feels paralyzing?

Golf is a tough game, and sometimes, just taking the club back is enough to confuse even a great player.

Learning how to master the golf takeaway takes a bit of practice, but most importantly, it takes an understanding of what the golf club SHOULD be doing.

We will show you what the golf takeaway is, why it’s difficult to repeat, and some drills and suggestions to help you master the golf takeaway.

What Is The Golf Takeaway?

The golf takeaway is the first part of the golf swing when the clubhead starts to move away from the golf ball. The takeaway is important as it helps get the club on the correct path.

If the takeaway is incorrect, it becomes difficult to recover and get the golf club on the proper plane.

When looking at improving the takeaway, you must consider the grip, the speed of the takeaway, and even how your body is starting to move. Golfers who shoot low scores can repeat their takeaway swing after swing.

The takeaway is a tricky part of the golf game for many amateur players.

A proper takeaway includes a solid golf grip, proper alignment and setup, and correct weight distribution.

Many amateurs tend to struggle with controlling the speed of their takeaway. The instinct is to be fast and get lots of speed – which does not work.

In addition, many amateurs have a hard time understanding what the clubface angle should look like as it moves away from the ball.

Perhaps most difficult is the fact that to be great at golf, you have to swing with some consistency, and that includes repeating the takeaway over and over again.

Mastering the Golf Takeaway (6 Essential Steps)

To get your golf takeaway down, you need to consider these 6 essential steps. The steps include grip, setup, weight distribution, initial movement, proper clubhead position, and then a transition into the golf swing.

If you can nail these, you’ll have that understanding that’s necessary to create repeatable golf swings

1. Grip

Having anything but a neutral grip on your golf club can negatively impact your golf takeaway. A strong or weak grip may manipulate the clubface more than necessary.

In addition, grip position can also change the positioning of your arms at setup and make it harder to get the club on the plane

Check the positioning of your hands and get them set so that you can take the club back on the right plane

2. Setup

Your setup should be square, making it easier to see the initial line to start your golf club.

A proper setup includes square feet, square hips, and square shoulders.

Also, check the clubhead position at setup and make sure it’s aligned correctly to your target.

3. Weight Distribution

Interestingly, where you have your weight in your setup can impact the takeaway of the golf club. Weight should be evenly distributed for most clubs in the bag.

If too much weight is on the right or left side, it may change your initial move away from the ball and make it difficult to transfer weight throughout the swing.

During the takeaway, your body will start turning. The takeaway is not just a movement of the arms, so having proper weight distribution gets this turn started properly.

For short irons, it’s acceptable to have a little extra weight on the left side (right-handed golfers).

4. Initial Swing Movement

The first move away from the golf ball should happen as one piece. Keep your arms low to the ground and ensure that you are starting to turn your lower body and shoulders. Your arms will create a triangle shape, and you will want to maintain this for the first part of the takeaway.

A common mistake that many amateur golfers struggle with is the concept of starting the golf swing by pulling the hands back and not engaging the body. Not only does this make it hard to maintain the triangle with your arms, but you could also cost yourself a lot of power and distance.

A proper turn starts in the takeaway, and it helps improve timing and tempo throughout the swing.

5. Clubhead Position

Your golf clubhead should remain outside your hands and aligned with the target line. If your club starts to roll open, you may get it too far inside. Instead, keep that face of the clubhead looking directly at your target for the first part of the takeaway.

With the proper turn and rotation in your golf swing, the clubface will do what it needs to do with very little manipulation on your part.

6. The Transition

Finally, you always want to make sure you can transition from setup to takeaway and from takeaway to backswing without any sudden movement. The entire swing needs to flow if you want to get distance and accuracy.

Try to remember that the takeaway does not need to be fast. Even some of the best players in the world have a slow takeaway. This slower start allows all the pieces to fall into place and won’t decrease speed at impact.

What Are The Signs of A Bad Golf Takeaway?

If you are wondering if your takeaway is the issue causing you trouble in your golf game, here are a few of the signs that you may be looking for.

The clubhead moving too far inside can lead to an inside-out swing path that creates both hooks and slices (depending on the clubface angle).

Hands taking over and controlling the entire takeaway can cause you to lose power.

A wrist hinge that happens during the takeaway can create an extremely steep path.

The triangle created by the arms starts to fall apart or become overly rigid, creating too much tension.

Neglecting to start a weight shift and body rotation at the start of the swing.

Abrupt movements that create inconsistency in the position of the club head.

Does The Takeaway Change From One Club To Another?

The takeaway should remain consistent from one golf club to the next. However, depending on what club you have in your hands, you may feel something slightly different.

With the length of a driver being different from irons and hybrids, many golfers feel their takeaway is a little wider with longer clubs. This swing thought is not a bad thing as it will help improve extension throughout the swing.

Even when hitting chip and pitch shots, you will feel the same movements in your takeaway.

On the putting green, things are a little different. Weight transfer won’t come into play, but the triangle with the arms and the control of the clubface are as important as ever.

Troubleshoot Your Golf Takeaway

If you find that mastering the golf takeaway is a difficult concept for you, there are a few ways to work on this process. The golf takeaway is something to work on when you are at the range, as it’s difficult to make changes and fixes while out on the course.

Take Video to Study Later

Take some videos of your golf takeaway so that you can look at the positions, the initial movements, and what is working and not working. Analyze the video in slow motion and see where the most significant issues are.

Continue to take updated videos and analyze the changes that you have made in your golf game.

StraightAway Training Aid

The StraightAway training aid is a good choice for working on your golf takeaway. The StraightAway is attached to any club and allows you to keep your hands, arms, body, and clubhead on track throughout the entire swing.

The StraightAway Training aid will help if your takeaway is too far inside, your hands get too far away from the body on the takeaway, your shoulders and hips do not turn at the start of your swing, and your overall consistency is not good.

For an affordable, portable solution that helps you keep a close eye on your takeaway, the StraightAway is a great solution.

Find a Great Coach

One of the great things about the golf takeaway is that once you know the steps, you can continue to repeat them and master the process over time. A great golf coach can help you learn what your golf takeaway is missing and eventually help you master it.

Perfecting the golf takeaway will lead to a better golf swing. Find a coach that works for your learning style and have them help you master the takeaway you can use for the rest of your golf career.

Final Thoughts on the Golf Takeaway

At this point, you have the basics of what it takes to build a perfect golf takeaway. Not all golfers will follow the same exact motion, but having a solid grip, setup, weight distribution, and clubhead positioning is quite important.

The takeaway is the catalyst for a great golf swing. Spend time working on it and learning what you need to do to perfect it. Find a great golf coach that will help you build this foundational part of your swing.

Master the takeaway to master the game of golf!",[],,www.performancegolf.com,"Have you ever felt like you didnt know how to start your golf swing? Like the starting movement almost feels paralyzing? Golf is a tough game, and sometimes, just taking the club back is enough to confuse even a great player. Learning how to master the golf takeaway takes a bit of practice, but most importantly, it takes an understanding of what the golf club SHOULD be doing. We will show you what the golf takeaway is, why its difficult to repeat, and some drills and suggestions to help you master the golf takeaway. What Is The Golf Takeaway? The golf takeaway is the first part of the golf swing when the clubhead starts to move away from the golf ball. The takeaway is important as it helps get the club on the correct path. If the takeaway is incorrect, it becomes difficult to recover and get the golf club on the proper plane. When looking at improving the takeaway, you must consider the grip, the speed of the takeaway, and even how your body is starting to move. Golfers who shoot low scores can repeat their takeaway swing after swing. The takeaway is a tricky part of the golf game for many amateur players. A proper takeaway includes a solid golf grip, proper alignment and setup, and correct weight distribution. Many amateurs tend to struggle with controlling the speed of their takeaway. The instinct is to be fast and get lots of speed  which does not work. In addition, many amateurs have a hard time understanding what the clubface angle should look like as it moves away from the ball. Perhaps most difficult is the fact that to be great at golf, you have to swing with some consistency, and that includes repeating the takeaway over and over again. Mastering the Golf Takeaway 6 Essential Steps To get your golf takeaway down, you need to consider these 6 essential steps. The steps include grip, setup, weight distribution, initial movement, proper clubhead position, and then a transition into the golf swing. If you can nail these, youll have that understanding thats necessary to create repeatable golf swings 1. Grip Having anything but a neutral grip on your golf club can negatively impact your golf takeaway. A strong or weak grip may manipulate the clubface more than necessary. In addition, grip position can also change the positioning of your arms at setup and make it harder to get the club on the plane Check the positioning of your hands and get them set so that you can take the club back on the right plane 2. Setup Your setup should be square, making it easier to see the initial line to start your golf club. A proper setup includes square feet, square hips, and square shoulders. Also, check the clubhead position at setup and make sure its aligned correctly to your target. 3. Weight Distribution Interestingly, where you have your weight in your setup can impact the takeaway of the golf club. Weight should be evenly distributed for most clubs in the bag. If too much weight is on the right or left side, it may change your initial move away from the ball and make it difficult to transfer weight throughout the swing. During the takeaway, your body will start turning. The takeaway is not just a movement of the arms, so having proper weight distribution gets this turn started properly. For short irons, its acceptable to have a little extra weight on the left side right-handed golfers. 4. Initial Swing Movement The first move away from the golf ball should happen as one piece. Keep your arms low to the ground and ensure that you are starting to turn your lower body and shoulders. Your arms will create a triangle shape, and you will want to maintain this for the first part of the takeaway. A common mistake that many amateur golfers struggle with is the concept of starting the golf swing by pulling the hands back and not engaging the body. Not only does this make it hard to maintain the triangle with your arms, but you could also cost yourself a lot of power and distance. A proper turn starts in the takeaway, and it helps improve timing and tempo throughout the swing. 5. Clubhead Position Your golf clubhead should remain outside your hands and aligned with the target line. If your club starts to roll open, you may get it too far inside. Instead, keep that face of the clubhead looking directly at your target for the first part of the takeaway. With the proper turn and rotation in your golf swing, the clubface will do what it needs to do with very little manipulation on your part. 6. The Transition Finally, you always want to make sure you can transition from setup to takeaway and from takeaway to backswing without any sudden movement. The entire swing needs to flow if you want to get distance and accuracy. Try to remember that the takeaway does not need to be fast. Even some of the best players in the world have a slow takeaway.

https://www.golfdistillery.com/swing-tips/takeaway/,How to Correctly Begin your Golf Swing at the Takeaway,"Illustrated Checklist & Tips

Use the golf tips below in order to improve your golf takeaway. The takeaway takes place immediately as you begin your golf swing – after the golf setup – and ends when the club is parallel to the ground which is when the backswing begins. The way you start your swing during the takeaway will have consequences on every swing sequence that follows.

Shaft Points at the Target during the Takeaway

During the takeaway the club should be brought back in line with the target line. Specifically, this means that when the shaft of the club is parallel to the ground the club should be pointing straight ahead on a line that is parallel to the target line.

This is in contrast to a club that would be pointing towards the right of the target (going back inside) or one that would be pointing towards the left of the target (going back outside).

More on:

Clubface is Aimed at the Ground Slightly

At the end of the takeaway – when the club shaft is parallel to the ground – the direction the clubface is facing is of particular importance.

Indeed, for shots that will penetrate through the air with all the possible vigor and in a straight line the leading edge of the club should tend to point towards the ground slightly, towards the ball.

This is in contrast to seeing the clubface pointing towards the sky (open) or towards the ground at a too steep angle (too closed).

More on:

Wrists Don’t Hinge Yet during the Takeaway

Another area to focus on during the takeaway concerns the way the wrists are hinging, and how soon they are.

Ideally, you will want to see the shaft of the club reach the position where it is parallel to the ground through the hands moving away from the front of your body via shoulder rotation. This is in contrast to seeing the clubhead rising very quickly through an early wrist hinge, which is not ideal for most normal shots.

Related Swing Thought:

Hands Stay in Front of the Chest (Keep the Triangle)

At address a triangle of the isosceles variety is formed by the butt of the club and your two shoulders as your hands are located directly in front of your chest.

During the takeaway this triangle is to be kept intact.

This means that as your hands are moved to the right they should do so using the rotation of your upper body (shoulders) in a way that your hands remain in front of your chest. This is contrast to moving your hands without rotating your upper body, which is achieved by the collapse of the right elbow.

Failure to keep your chest from facing your hands at this stage will lead the club into an incorrect path that will translate into issues as you progress with your swing.

Wrist Hinge in the Golf Swing (Key Takeaways)

If you don’t have time right now to dive into the details of the wrist hinge in golf, at least take these important points with you.

Here are the key things to remember about the proper wrist hinge in golf:

Wrist hinging does not occur at the same time for all players. However, positions at the top of the swing and at impact are the most important.

However, positions at the top of the swing and at impact are the most important. To check proper wrist hinge in golf , you must look for flexion and extension angles as well as ulnar and radial deviation; the best way to do this is using HackMotion.

Wrist motion and wrist hinge in golf are and should be subtle. Sequence and timing are just as important as the amount of wrist hinge. During the takeaway, all golfers have to combine a certain amount of turn and wrist movement to get the club in the correct position at the top.

During the takeaway, all golfers have to combine a certain amount of turn and wrist movement to get the club in the correct position at the top. Wrist angles control the clubface. Until your wrist hinge is consistent and correctly timed, it’s very difficult to hit golf shots with a square face.

What is the Proper Wrist Hinge in Golf?

The proper wrist hinge in golf will vary depending on the player, type of golf swing, and even the shot you are trying to play.

However, when it comes to wrist angles and hinge at impact, there are certain patterns that we continually see professionals repeat. After analyzing more than 1,000,000 swings, it becomes easier to see what works and what does not.

These angles in the golf swing have been studied and analyzed by professional golfers. The goal of a proper wrist hinge is to ensure that no matter how you take the club back, you can get your club into a square position at impact.

Why is Wrist Hinge Important in Golf Swing?

The wrists control the clubface.

Yes, it is as simple as that. If you want to have a square clubface at impact, you must be able to manage the wrist hinge in your golf game.

Wrist hinge leads to the positioning of the club at the top, which then impacts the transition to the downswing, eventually controlling where your clubface is at impact. Pretty important!

If you are not aware of your wrist hinge and the impact it has on the golf swing, try this drill.

Take one swing where you feel like you don’t hinge your wrists until the top of the swing. Then, take a swing where you set your wrists almost immediately after taking the clubface away from the ball.

The difference in these two swings will likely feel huge, and one or the other may make it easier for you to get a square clubface at impact.

How Wrist Hinge Affects Your Backswing?

The amount of hinge in your wrists during the backswing will have a significant impact on the positioning of the club.

Here are the key factors in golf impacted by wrist hinge:

Leverage: Proper wrist hinge increases leverage and power.

Proper wrist hinge increases leverage and power. Swing Plane: Wrist hinge in the backswing affects swing plane, trajectory, and direction.

Wrist hinge in the backswing affects swing plane, trajectory, and direction. Clubface Position: Wrist controls clubface; proper hinge leads to a square clubface at impact.

Good wrist hinge extends the backswing, boosting speed and distance. Timing: A consistent wrist hinge improves rhythm, flow, and consistency in your swing.

How Much Wrist Hinge Do You Want?

At this point, I’ve probably got you curious about whether you hinge your wrists early or late or even if you hinge them enough.

In this video from Zach Allen, you can learn a great deal about the timing of wrist hinge and what that does to your golf swing. You may be surprised to see how ulnar and radial deviation play into this process.

Hinging Early

Hinging your wrists early in the golf swing means that by the time your club gets to parallel, you have already started to hinge your wrists.

For golfers who like more of a compact swing with a lot of pivoting and body rotation, an early hinge is a great option. An early wrist hinge is not the answer for everyone.

With the early hinge, when you get to the top of the swing, you will often have a little less work to do to rotate the clubface to a square position for impact.

In fact, many players like this early hinge because then they can just turn their way through impact.

The problem with the early wrist hinge is the lack of extension and length it creates in the golf swing. It can impact the overall power of your shots. Stronger players with better speed often have an easier time with the early hinge method.

Hinging Late

Hinging late sounds like it’s a bad thing, almost like you forgot to hinge.

That is not true.

In fact, hinging late is something that many golf professionals do to create extension in their arms throughout the swing. If you look at Tiger Woods’ golf swing, he has very little wrist hinge and creates power with proper timing, consistency and descent angle.

With the late hinge, your wrists don’t hinge until you get to the top of your swing. Late wrist hinge kind of happens with the weight of the club in the hands, more than a deliberate movement in the takeaway.

One interesting thing that we know about professional golfers (especially those who hinge at the top) is that they work very hard to square that clubface up as soon as possible on the downswing.

The early squaring of the clubface allows for more rotational forces and speed through impact.

During the takeaway of a golf swing with a later hinge, you will notice more extension and a rounder-looking swing arc.

Most golfers can figure out how to hinge the wrists; the question is how to get the right amount of wrist hinge at the right time.

Once you find that perfect amount (for your swing!), then you can work on other things like weight shift, speed, turning, and, most importantly, clubface control.

Although your wrists can hinge at a time in the swing that works for your game, you must ensure that the club is on the proper plane after the wrists hinge. Some golfers struggle with the flex in their wrists, and this impacts both the clubface angle and the hinge of the wrists.

One of the best ways to practice this is to use HackMotion swing analyzer.

HackMotion is like wearing your coach on your wrists. Not only can you check on the amount of wrist hinge but also the timing of the hinge to make sure it’s accurate.

The HackMotion data is based on more than 1,000,000 golf swings and what truly works for players from a consistency standpoint.

As you wear the HackMotion sensor, you can see how far you are from the proper wrist position and then make adjustments to ensure the wrist is not too flexed or bowed or not hinged enough to create a square clubface.

HackMotion gives you feedback as you are swinging, allowing for real-time adjustments.

Work on both an early and a delayed wrist hinge to see which is more consistent for your golf game.

Best Ways (and Drills) to Practice Your Own Proper Wrist Hinge

Perhaps the most frustrating thing about wrist hinge is that there is no perfect way to do it. Working on this position through drills is a great way to experiment and see what works best for you.

Here are a few of our favorite drills to improve the wrist hinge.

The Early Set Drill

With the early set drill, you pick the club up so that it is directly in front of you, essentially hinge the wrists so that the club is parallel with the ground.

Once you have the club in this position, rotate back so that you have made an upper and lower body rotation.

Now you can see the club at the proper position with the wrists hinged, the club on plane, and your body rotated. From this position, you should be able to just turn and get yourself through the ball to hit a straight shot.

Extend the Takeaway

If you feel like your wrists are too active in the initial parts of the golf swing, a lower and slower takeaway can help calm things down.

Golfers who extend their takeaway and feel a bit wider at the start will end up having a wrist hinge closer to the top of their backswing.

The delayed wrist hinge can feel more powerful for those who have less strength and torque.

Blend Drill

Jason Porzak does a great job of setting up a wrist hinge drill that helps players combine how much wrist hinge and how much turn is needed in the takeaway.

It’s a common mistake for golfers to make too much turn or too much hinge and have that make it difficult to get the clubface to square at impact.

Use the HackMotion to Help

HackMotion pinpoints the exact issues in your golf game that occur due to your wrist action.

When wearing the HackMotion device on your lead wrist, you can learn exactly where the issues with wrist positioning and hinge happen in your swing. Essentially, you can take all the guesswork out of finding swing issues and rely on this technology instead.

Wrist hinge leads to the positioning of the club at the top, which then impacts the transition to the downswing, eventually controlling where your clubface is at impact. Pretty important! If you are not aware of your wrist hinge and the impact it has on the golf swing, try this drill. Take one swing where you feel like you dont hinge your wrists until the top of the swing. Then, take a swing where you set your wrists almost immediately after taking the clubface away from the ball.

For golfers who like more of a compact swing with a lot of pivoting and body rotation, an early hinge is a great option. An early wrist hinge is not the answer for everyone. With the early hinge, when you get to the top of the swing, you will often have a little less work to do to rotate the clubface to a square position for impact. In fact, many players like this early hinge because then they can just turn their way through impact. The problem with the early wrist hinge is the lack of extension and length it creates in the golf swing. It can impact the overall power of your shots. Stronger players with better speed often have an easier time with the early hinge method. Hinging Late Hinging late sounds like its a bad thing, almost like you forgot to hinge. That is not true. In fact, hinging late is something that many golf professionals do to create extension in their arms throughout the swing. If you look at Tiger Woods golf swing, he has very little wrist hinge and creates power with proper timing, consistency and descent angle. With the late hinge, your wrists dont hinge until you get to the top of your swing. Late wrist hinge kind of happens with the weight of the club in the hands, more than a deliberate movement in the takeaway. One interesting thing that we know about professional golfers especially those who hinge at the top is that they work very hard to square that clubface up as soon as possible on the downswing. The early squaring of the clubface allows for more rotational forces and speed through impact.

https://www.golfdistillery.com/swing-thoughts/top-of-the-swing/full-wrist-hinge-at-the-top/,Full Wrist Hinge at the Top,"This swing thought reminds you to position your wrists at a fully hinged position at the top of your swing. This is in contrast to reaching the top of the swing before the wrists have had time to hinge completely, or to simply opt not to hinge them completely for whatever reason.

What it promotes

Starting the downswing with wrists that are fully hinged will promote what is referred to as lag. Assuming that you are not allowing that hinge to unwind too soon – before the club strikes the ball – hands should travel past the ball ahead of the clubhead, a crucial component of a solid contact.

Furthermore, making sure your wrists are fully hinged will promote a whipping motion at the ball as the club travels towards the ball for impact, promoting ideal distance and ball flight height.

What it tries to cure

Golfers whose balls are sent on a lower than normal ball flight will benefit from checking to make sure their wrists are positioned correctly at the top.

Otherwise, those who feel their shots don’t travel as far as they should can also benefit from using this swing key.

Why it works

In order for shots to travel their full distances and to do so in the trajectory the club used to hit them was designed for, enough energy must be built and stored ahead of impact. There are many ways to create and store that energy.

Primarily, it is done through the rotation of the hips and shoulders as they are coiled back during the backswing. While those movements use big muscles, generating extra energy can be achieved using the movements of the wrists through correct and carefully executed hinging.

When is it most useful?

This swing key can be implemented for all types of full swing shots. Only for shots where the club is not brought all the way back up can you safely ignore the advice presented here.",[],2018-02-13 16:45:58+00:00,www.golfdistillery.com,"This swing thought reminds you to position your wrists at a fully hinged position at the top of your swing.

Only for shots where the club is not brought all the way back up can you safely ignore the advice presented here.","['This swing thought reminds you to position your wrists at a fully hinged position at the top of your swing. This is in contrast to reaching the top of the swing before the wrists have had time to hinge completely, or to simply opt not to hinge them completely for whatever reason. What it promotes Starting the downswing with wrists that are fully hinged will promote what is referred to as lag. Assuming that you are not allowing that hinge to unwind too soon before the club strikes the ball hands should travel past the ball ahead of the clubhead, a crucial component of a solid contact. Furthermore, making sure your wrists are fully hinged will promote a whipping motion at the ball as the club travels towards the ball for impact, promoting ideal distance and ball flight height. What it tries to cure Golfers whose balls are sent on a lower than normal ball flight will benefit from checking to make sure their wrists are positioned correctly at the top. Otherwise, those who feel their shots dont travel as far as they should can also benefit from using this swing key. Why it works In order for shots to travel their full distances and to do so in the trajectory the club used to hit them was designed for, enough energy must be built and stored ahead of impact. There are many ways to create and store that energy. Primarily, it is done through the rotation of the hips and shoulders as they are coiled back during the backswing. While those movements use big muscles, generating extra energy can be achieved using the movements of the wrists through correct and carefully executed hinging. When is it most useful? This swing key can be implemented for all types of full swing shots. Only for shots where the club is not brought all the way back up can you safely ignore the advice presented here.']"

Three Key Checkpoints for Proper Wrist Hinge

Proper wrist hinge should be established early in the swing to prevent compensations later. The best ball strikers consistently follow these three key checkpoints:

90-Degree Hinge

By the time the lead arm reaches the parallel position in relation to the ground in the backswing, there should be approximately a 90-degree angle between the lead arm and the club shaft. This ensures proper wrist loading for a controlled and powerful downswing.

Correct Hinge Plane

The club should be hinged along a plane that aligns with or is just inside the ball-target line. This prevents excessive deviations that could lead to inconsistencies in clubface control and impact position.

Flat Lead Wrist

The lead wrist should transition from a slightly cupped position at setup to a flat position when the lead arm reaches parallel. This promotes a square clubface and proper shaft positioning for optimal ball striking.

Understanding Proper Wrist Motion

Wrist motion in the golf swing consists of two key movements:

The lead wrist controls the up-and-down motion (hinging the club like a hammer).

controls the up-and-down motion (hinging the club like a hammer). The trail wrist controls the back-and-forth motion (bending backward to support a flat lead wrist).

A common mistake golfers make is increasing the cupping of the lead wrist when hinging up, which steepens the club shaft and opens the clubface. To counter this, the trail wrist must bend back properly, promoting a shallower plane and square clubface.

A Simple Drill to Train Wrist Hinge

To train proper wrist hinge, follow this two-part drill.

Using only your lead hand, hinge the club up and in front of you (above left) to about 90 degrees, then hinge it down to strike the ground. Repeat three times.

Next, grip the club with your trail hand and focus on bending your wrist back (knuckles toward the forearm) in the backswing (above right). This motion helps flatten the lead wrist, ensuring a more consistent and effective impact position.

Finally, combine these motions by feeling the lead wrist hinge up and the trail wrist bend back progressively throughout the backswing.

The Importance of Proper Wrist Hinge

Proper wrist hinge provides two critical benefits:

Increased Power – Without wrist hinge, swing speed is significantly reduced, leading to weak shots.

– Without wrist hinge, swing speed is significantly reduced, leading to weak shots. Better Ball Contact – Wrist hinge ensures the clubhead descends properly, allowing for solid strikes with ball-first contact..

By incorporating these principles into your practice routine, you’ll improve both the consistency and power of your golf swing.

There are a number of misperceptions when it comes to golf swing rotation. A lot of golfers think they are doing it right, but have no good way to check without the help of an instructor. If you think poor shoulder rotation in your golf swing is draining your shots of power, if you’re not sure if you are rotating correctly, or if you think you lack flexibility to get enough rotation in your golf swing, then what follows is for you. We'll go over the do's and don'ts of rotation in the golf swing to help you get increased clubhead speed that comes with a good turn. Getting more body rotation in your golf swing will eliminate lots of inconsistencies in your ball striking by shifting control of your swing away from your arms and smaller muscles and onto your much more consistent larger muscles. In this article we will cover...

Rotation Basics: Turning vs. Tilting

When it comes to golf swing rotation, some golfers tend to cheat by just tilting or swaging. Be it lack of flexibility, or a misunderstanding of how to rotate the shoulders and hips to achieve proper golf swing rotation, there are those who rely entirely on their arms to get to the top of their backswing. The result is a tilt in your body, or worse a collapse of your spine angle forward into what feels like a decent backswing position but which in reality has little or no rotation around your spine. A golf swing without rotation loses its greatest source of power and gets your entire body out of sync, it becomes nearly impossible to get back to a nice square impact position resulting reduced distance and shots that are wildly off target.

To achieve the correct shoulder turn in your golf swing your rotation must include the hips. If done correctly, flexibility hardly factors into the equation. If you're a tilter, you'll be amazed how far you can rotate your shoulders without straining at all if you simply turn your hips as well. A proper shoulder turn involves turning your hips and torso. It relies on big muscles to drive the motion, and big muscles equal big power. By rotating your hips your front shoulder has room to rotate downward, allowing you to maintain your posture and stay on the proper swing plane. If done correctly your shoulders should turn down and under your chin, not out and around. From this rotated position you can return the club back to the ball squarely with more power instead of just throwing or casting your arms to get to impact.

Proper Shoulder Turn

Top 50 Young Golf Instructor and Golf Channel Academy Lead Instructor Devan Bonebrake's swing is perfect for demonstrating proper golf swing rotation.

Both hips and shoulders are turning

Shoulders turning more than the hips

Ideally, shoulders turning 90 degrees away from the target line

Front shoulder turning down and under on the proper swing plane

Feeling tension in the big muscles due to the difference in rotation between the shoulders and hips

Even with a lack of upper body flexibility, if you can turn your hips like Devan you can get your shoulders turned much more relative to your target line creating more power in your golf swing.

Incorrect Shoulder Turn

There's a lot that can go wrong when it comes to rotation in your golf swing. Be sure to avoid the following.

Hips remaining almost square to the target, or hardly rotating

Shoulders that don't rotate as close to 90 degrees as possible

The body collapses or tilts forward instead of turning around the spine

Front shoulder move up and around instead of down and under

No tension in the big muscles with all power being forced to come from the arms

Practice Your Rotation Using Swing Align

It has always been difficult to see your own body’s rotation during your golf swing. It’s one of the more helpful things a second pair of eyes can provide, and a big reason why getting lessons from a golf instructor can help you improve. But without any help, how do you know if you’ve rotated enough in your golf swing? By using Swing Align of course!



The best and easiest way to see the amount of your body’s rotation at the top of your golf swing is the visual from the alignment rods when you wear the Swing Align device. You should also use a ground based alignment tool - like the Swing Junction. Swing Junction allows you to add a small alignment rod perpendicular (90 degrees) to your target line. By turning your shoulders to match the alignment rod on your arms with the perpendicular alignment rod on the ground, it becomes easy to get immediate feedback on how much your upper body and torso has rotated. Remember to rotate your hips to help allow your upper body to rotate more freely!

Ideally, at the top of your backswing, the alignment rod you are wearing on your upper body will be perpendicular (90 degrees) to your target line. You also want the front end of the alignment rod across your arms pointing slightly downward, toward the ground. Getting the rod to be either level with the ground or with the front end pointing slightly down at the top of your swing, indicates that you have turned your shoulders down and under, maintained the proper spine angle and you are on the proper swing plane! Helping you rotate on the proper swing plane is a strength of the Swing Align device.



Go: At the top of your swing the rod across your chest should be perpendicular to your target line. Note: using a rod on the ground outside your back foot placed at 90 degrees serves as a great visual target.

No Go: If the rod does not approach perpendicular to your target line or points up in the air, you have failed to rotate properly.

If you are struggling to get your body fully rotated at the top of your backswing and on the proper swing plane, it could be because you are setting up with your shoulders open to your target line, or during the takeaway your shoulders, arms, or the club is getting out of position. Use the set-up and takeaway content in our Instruction section to check these key swing areas.

Using a Swing Align golf swing trainer to rehearse the correct body positions associated with golf swing rotation works as well, as long as you know what to look for. And you can do this in your house, or garage, or out on the range while you hit balls without another soul around. Seeing and feeling the correct rotation, and knowing how to check the correct amount of rotation, will create a more consistent golf swing that delivers both power and accuracy!

https://kenworthygolf.com/2017/11/17/rory-square-clubface-top-backswing/,How To Achieve A Square Clubface At The Top Of The Backswing,"I try very hard to practice what I preach. Golf instruction is primarily an effort to prioritize faults and maintain consistent efforts to improve them. Like most golfers, I am easily tempted to shift focus for any number of reasons. The most common cause of this shift is when we struggle but we often are just as distracted by good shots or a string of respectable scores. I wrote an article earlier called “Why You Don’t Improve” that touches on this topic but here I want to dig a bit further using a specific fault in my swing. How do we achieve a square clubface at the top of the backswing and what roles do the left wrist and grip play?

I very often struggle with an extremely open clubface at the top of the backswing. These are two older swings of mine. The driver on the left approximates a face angle of 60 degrees and the iron swing shows a face even more open at 64 degrees.

There are several examples of young, very successful tour players who swing the club with an open face. Superstars like Hideki Matsuyama, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas all have a relatively open clubface position at the top of the backswing.

Note however that their “open” clubfaces measure at approximately 50 degrees and not in the 60s. All three of these pros have very “weak” grips compared to the standard on tour. They also position their left hands on the grip such that they only see 1-2 knuckles. Golfers with weaker grips will often exhibit a more open face at the top as a result of the need for a comfortable position with the left wrist.

What does a square clubface look like?

There are a myriad of axioms in golf instruction that cover this topic. Instructors like to say that you should “match the leading edge of the face to the left arm” or “just focus on a square left wrist.” Modern technology gives us the ability to simply measure. As a disclaimer, I must note that there are a number of variables here and my conclusion is not an absolute but simply a very close approximation. A square clubface at the top of the backswing is about 40 degrees.

There are several ways to verify this including several tour swings and an exercise you can do in the mirror at home. One of the lowest maintenance and technically sound golf swings on tour belongs to Steve Stricker. If you visualize his golf swing you might think of a “hands-free” or simple action.

Of all the swings I studied, there was no one whose swing and clubface position I found more enviable than Rory McIlroy. You can see him here both with a driver and an iron at the top.

Rory measures pretty consistently at 42 degrees and displays a slightly cupped left wrist position as compared to the other swings I’ve shown. Before we discuss this wrist position and why I think it’s worth copying, go find a club and a mirror and try this out.

At Home Square Clubface Exercise

Setup to the mirror to view your swing from down the line. Cock your wrists until the club shaft is parallel to the ground. Rotate your torso until the shaft is parallel to your imaginary target line. Without manipulating the club with your hands simply raise your arms into a top of the backswing position. What does the face look like? If you did this correct, it will look almost exactly like Rory and Stricker.

The Link Between Grip and Wrist Position

Let’s take a closeup look at the left hand of Rory’s grip.

.

This is the grip as I would teach it and what I consider “standard” The crease between Rory’s thumb and forefinger points just outside his right ear. He can see approximately 2-3 knuckles and there is a slight cupping in his wrist.

Earlier I mentioned that Justin, Hideki, and Jordan all had relatively weak grips. A weak grip makes it more difficult to keep the clubface from opening during the backswing. An overly strong grip (3+ knuckles) has the opposite effect but is much more common among good golfers. For Justin, Hideki, and Jordan to achieve a square face at the top they would have to bow their left wrist into a fairly unnatural position. You can try this yourself in a mirror.

Grip the club with an extremely weak left hand(1 knuckle or less) and take the club to the top. The face will very likely look open unless you’ve flattened or bowed your left wrist. While swinging the club with a flat or bowed left wrist is not that uncommon, it’s simply not the best method for most golfers.

The ideal position that Rory achieves is one that exhibits a “standard” grip, a slight cupping in the left wrist at the top, and a square clubface. From this position he has a much greater chance of delivering a square clubface at impact as opposed to myself in those swings that I showed in the beginning.

In a future article, I want to illustrate and discuss the range of common clubface positions at the top using Tiger Woods. Through the years he had a wide display of positions but you’ll never guess where his face angle was in the year 2000. Here’s a sneak preview of sorts…

Back To My Swing

During a recent practice session, I’m focusing my efforts on trying to avoid the super open clubface at the top. I generally work my way through the bag by hitting 5-10 shots per club and filming one swing per club. If the swing I filmed doesn’t look right, I will drill my way through the next several shots, try to establish a new feel, and film again.

During this process I flushed a 7 iron that I recorded. It was right on target and carried about 175 yards. I was pretty excited to look at the video. Here is what I saw at the top of the swing.

Let’s move up the bag to a longer club, right? Well, the next few frames of the video really got my attention.

In transition I managed to open my clubface from 40 degrees to 47 degrees. Why did this happen? I’ve spent years swinging the club with an extremely open face at the top and it’s only “natural” for my hands and wrists to want to manipulate the face into a more comfortable position at full speed.

What is so scary about this is that I didn’t feel it. In fact, my memory of my feel at the time was that I had produced the position I had been practicing. This of course makes sense given the first image. In the swings that followed I was able to account for this properly, adjust my feel, and get it some great reps.

Britt Olizarowicz Share

As a golfer, you likely know that a square clubface at impact is key to success. However, the position of the clubface at the top of the swing is not discussed as often.

Some players have an open clubface at the top of their swing, while others have a slightly closed face.

The question is, which is better?

This guide covers everything you need to know about a golf club being open or closed at the top of the swing and, most importantly, how to make the necessary adjustments to square the clubface at impact.

Key Takeaways

If you don’t have time to read the article about open vs. closed clubface at the top right now, here are the key takeaways and a video that will explain things to you.

Top-of-swing = Impact Control: Your clubface position at the top largely determines how easily you can square it at impact.

Your clubface position at the top largely determines how easily you can square it at impact. Slightly Closed is Often Easiest: A slightly closed (or square) clubface typically needs fewer compensations on the downswing.

A slightly closed (or square) clubface typically needs fewer compensations on the downswing. Wrist Position Matters: Flexed wrist = closed face; extended wrist = open face. Find the balance that works best for you.

Flexed wrist = closed face; extended wrist = open face. Find the balance that works best for you. Remember: There’s no perfect way to do it—it’s about matching up your top-of-swing face angle with your body rotation so you can square the face at impact.

There’s no perfect way to do it—it’s about matching up your top-of-swing face angle with your body rotation so you can square the face at impact. Use Feedback Tools: HackMotion gives real-time wrist-angle feedback, making it easier to build the right habit and see consistent results.

Should the Clubface Be Open or Closed at the Top of the Swing?

In general, a slightly closed or square clubface at the top is easiest to square at impact. When the face is just a bit closed, less “work” is needed on the downswing.

This should help to boost speed and consistency. A fully square position is great if you can achieve it consistently, but many players find a slightly closed top-of-swing more reliable.

Here’s how each option affects the downswing:

Open Face (Too Much Extension)

Requires more wrist action (reducing extension) on the downswing.

Can slow clubhead speed if you must “flip” the face square.

Easier to hit fades and avoid left-side misses, but it risks slices.

Closed Face (Too Much Flex/Bowing)

May need a bit of extension on the downswing to avoid hooking.

Encourages faster body rotation and can produce powerful draws.

Helps eliminate last-second face manipulation for many players.

Which Method is Easier?

After studying more than 1,000,000 golf swings with HackMotion, we know that golfers with the best results have a square or slightly closed clubface at the top.

Ultimately, there’s no universal “right or wrong” angle—only the position that helps you square up the clubface consistently at impact.

For golfers who rotate their bodies well, the slightly closed clubface at the top is the best way to generate speed and square the face at impact. Ultimately, you’ll need to match your body movement to the wrist angle at the top of your backswing.

How to Practice Clubface Position at the Top of the Swing

Because you can’t see your clubface at the top, rely on tools and drills. HackMotion helps you work on your wrist position at the top in real-time.

You’ll get immediate audio/vibration feedback about your wrist position to help you make swing changes faster.

Below are some of the best drills to help you master clubface control at the top. You can try these even if you don’t have HackMotion yet.

However, the app’s interactive drills make it easier and faster to achieve the correct wrist position relative to your setup.

Proven Drills to Perfect Clubface Position at the Top

Each drill below correlates the top-of-swing clubface position with a better impact position.

If you can learn to get square (or slightly closed) at the top, you’ll have an easier time delivering the face square at impact.

Static Top-of-Backswing Drill

If you can’t get your position at the top of the backswing correct in slow motion, how can you get it at full speed?

The Static Top of Backswing Drill is going to slow you down and help you ingrain the feel of a neutral or slightly closed face at the top of the backswing.

Confirm with HackMotion that you are in the “green” zone with a flat or within range lead wrist. Return to address. Repeat 10 times and then take a few full swings or repeat the drill with a bit more speed.

Dynamic Top-of-Backswing Drill

Once you have that position down you can transition into a normal speed swing using the Dynamic Top-of Backswing drill.

This drill will encourage you to pick up a little speed and pause for less time at the top.

Dynamic Top Drill in HackMotion The Dynamic Top-of-Backswing Drill helps you learn to square the clubface in real time without overthinking. You’ll also start feeling the fluid transition from the top to impact. Explore HackMotion Today

Pause briefly to check that your clubface is in the correct position. Complete your downswing and hit the ball. Gradually increase to full speed once you can consistently find the right position.

Motorcycle Drill

Once you feel more confident with the wrist position at the top of the backswing, you can move to the motorcycle drill.

Not only does the motorcycle drill help bring awareness to your clubface position at the top and improves the transition from the backswing to the downswing.

The golfer who can get the motorcycle movement down will be less likely to flip their wrists at impact. In addition, they will have better energy transfer and consistency at impact.

The Motorcycle drill is one of the best wrist action drills you will find.

Motorcycle Drill – Master Wrist Flexion in the Downswing Focus on continuously adding flexion until the club reaches parallel, then smoothly complete your swing. Explore HackMotion Today

Print Motorcycle Drill Motorcycle Drill – Step by Step Setup as you normally would at address. Swing to the top of the backswing, and then, as you swing down, you feel like you’re revving a motorcycle. The wrist will flex slightly, helping to square the clubface earlier in the downswing.

Final Thoughts

The wrists control the clubface. While an open face at the top of your swing can help you work the ball left-to-right it often requires more timing and risk of right-side misses.

A closed face can lead to powerful draws and a simpler downswing, but you may risk hooking if you don’t rotate well.

The slightly closed or square clubface is a strong middle ground for most golfers, requiring fewer compensations.

Should the Clubface Be Open or Closed at the Top of the Swing? In general, a slightly closed or square clubface at the top is easiest to square at impact. When the face is just a bit closed, less work is needed on the downswing. This should help to boost speed and consistency. A fully square position is great if you can achieve it consistently, but many players find a slightly closed top-of-swing more reliable. Heres how each option affects the downswing Open Face Too Much Extension Requires more wrist action reducing extension on the downswing. Can slow clubhead speed if you must flip the face square. Easier to hit fades and avoid left-side misses, but it risks slices. Closed Face Too Much FlexBowing May need a bit of extension on the downswing to avoid hooking. Encourages faster body rotation and can produce powerful draws. Helps eliminate last-second face manipulation for many players. Which Method is Easier? After studying more than 1,000,000 golf swings with HackMotion, we know that golfers with the best results have a square or slightly closed clubface at the top. Ultimately, theres no universal right or wrong angleonly the position that helps you square up the clubface consistently at impact. For golfers who rotate their bodies well, the slightly closed clubface at the top is the best way to generate speed and square the face at impact. Ultimately, youll need to match your body movement to the wrist angle at the top of your backswing.

Two of the biggest money winners in PGA Tour history are Jim Fuyrk and Matt Kuchar, and they could not be further away from each other at the top of the swing. The acceptable corridors to swing the club back are so much larger than coming down. The golf downswing, in particular coming into the ball shallow versus steep, is what separates all levels of ball strikers.

The Golf Downswing Sequence

The key factor in how to start the downswing in golf is the sequence. This is the DNA of a golf swing, and really what separates the best players from high handicappers. Just like all other athletic movements, there is a pattern of movement that is needed for consistent ball-then-turf contact, accuracy and distance.

1. Good arm structure at the top

While there can be some variety in how you complete your backswing it is imperative to rotate your way there. Keep your arms and body connected, don't just lift your arms to the top. Ben Hogan thought about keeping his elbows close together on the way back, and the way down!

2. Plant the Left Heel

The golf swing starts from the ground up. Just before the upper body and arms stop going back, the lower body is starting the downswing. Putting pressure into the lead foot early in the transition is a big key to setting up the rest of the downswing.

3. Shift Your Pressure There should be pressure moving into your trail foot early in the backswing but before starting down, pressure moves back onto your lead side. This sets up the downswing chain of events with the torso then arms following accordingly. A well-timed pressure shift back and through is one of the major influences of good timing and rhythm in a golf swing.

4. Knees Follow the Hips

The hips should move back towards the target before anything else, although a lot of players might feel it is their knees. The big key here again is to think of starting the downswing from the ground up but in order to do that feel the ground under your lead side by bumping your hips forward.





5. Rotate Hips Before Arms

The rotation of the lower body first helps drop the arms down before moving them around. Moving the arms first and pulling them results in out and ""over the top"" ending up in the Death position with a steep shaft angle and narrow downswing. From this position consistent shots will be few and far between. So be patient, allow the lower body to initiate to first and then feel the hands and arms drop to start the downswing. From there, just like in other athletic movements, your body rotation will create speed in the arms.

6. Tuck Your Trail Elbow

The trail elbow Once the lower body starts the downswing, the arms drop, the upper torso will quickly follow.works in and close to the body and under the lead elbow. This is what gets the club on a shallow and inside track, ready to be delivered with rotation and more power! A large separation of the elbows at the top or after the transition starts will get the club too steep.

7. Keep The Lead Shoulder Down lead shoulder One other thing I see with players who struggle to shallow the club when starting the downswing is that they try to use their shoulders to get their trail arm under their lead arm. If yourmoves up you stand up out of your posture and get too steep. Although it is important that the trail arm works under the lead arm in the transition, it is important to do so while keeping the lead shoulder and chest down. This combination leads to beautiful results at impact.





8. Wrist Bend and Hinge

With the correct lower body, torso, and arm sequence, it is almost automatic that your wrists will bend in a bowing motion versus scooping. And the clubhead will lag behind your hands with your wrists unhinging late for maximum power and flush contact.





Start a Correct Downswing with Swing Align!

So, how to put it all together, how to start the downswing? The correct golf downswing sequence starts with a pressure shift to the lead leg, followed by your arms dropping and elbow starting to tuck close to your body to shallow the angle of the club, before rotating the torso through to impact. Using the Swing Align device is a huge help in visualizing and rehearsing these complicated body positions, in particular when it comes to how to start the downswing. When the lead arm is parallel to the ground on the way down, make sure the rod across your chest stays level or pointed slightly down toward the ball.

At this the trail arm should be moving under the lead arm. You should still have the same spine angle with your lead shoulder and chest down. Don’t stand up out of your posture! As your golf downswing sequence continues, and the club approaches parallel with the ground, your trail elbow should be close to your body. Your shoulders will level out and the front end of the alignment rod should start to point up. Understanding and practicing this sequence, and seeing it demonstrated physically by Swing Align, will do a lot to help you improve!

What not to do! The two big no-no’s are as follows.

An aggressive arm pull, or upper body lunge from the top. This will get the club too steep and kill a successful downswing with little chance to hit a good shot. Do not start the downswing with your arms! Standing up and coming out of your posture early. This is one of the worst moves you can make in a golf swing. Although the intention is good, the results will be disastrous, coming in steep, toe down and face generally open, with a loss of both power and control.

HackMotion Share

Lag is a critical element in the transition from backswing to downswing and significantly impacts your ability to compress the ball and gain extra yardage.

After analyzing over 1,000,000 golf swings using HackMotion, we’ve uncovered valuable insights into how wrist action contributes to creating lag.

If adding lag and improving your ball striking are your goals, these tips and drills will set you on the right path.

Creating Lag in The Golf Swing (Key Takeaways)

If you don’t have time to read our guide on understanding lag, here are the most important things to remember.

Lag requires proper sequencing: pressure into the lead foot, unwinding hips, chest rotation, and a shallowing club.

Avoid excessive cupping (extension) in the lead wrist to prevent an open clubface and ineffective lag.

Adding radial deviation (wrist hinge) during the downswing is ineffective for increasing lag in the golf swing.

Body rotation during the downswing is essential for maintaining lag and ensuring a powerful, controlled impact.

HackMotion provides real-time feedback and drills on wrist angles to improve lag control and swing performance.

What Do I Need to Understand to Create Lag?

Lag refers to the angle between the lead forearm and the club shaft during the downswing. For amateurs, it feels like the club trails behind the hands through impact.

Maintaining this lag allows for a whip-like action in the clubhead, leading to increased clubhead speed and greater distance.

Proper lag also contributes to better timing and sequencing of the swing, ensuring a more efficient transfer of energy to the ball at impact.

The Common Myth that Exists about Lag in Golf

Lag is not about aggressively increasing wrist hinge (the ‘Sergio Garcia’ myth).

Instead, it’s about sequencing: allowing the club head to fall behind the hands naturally as you shallow the club.

Many times, when we see faces in pictures or videos of Sergio or any other professional on the downswing, they seem to increase their wrist hinge or radial deviation. This is an illusion. From a down-the-line view, they shallow the club with proper sequencing.

Professionals very rarely increase the wrist angle, or their radial deviation, on the downswing.

How to Create Lag in the Golf Swing

It is crucial to understand wrist movements and their role in creating lag.

To improve lag, you must ensure that your wrists are in the right position and that you approach the golf ball with the lead wrist flexed.

Proper Wrist Positions to Create Lag

Wearing the HackMotion can help you become aware of your wrist positioning during the backswing. The most important wrist measurements are the extension (cupping) and flexion (bowing) of the lead wrist.

Excessive extension at any point in the swing reduces lag and opens the clubface, leading to weak shots.

Static Top Drill in HackMotion Use the HackMotion Static Top Drill to help reduce extension in the backswing. Explore HackMotion Today

Print Static Top Drill Static Top Drill – Step by Step Start at the address position. Swing to the top of the swing and stop. Check to make sure wrist angles are in the green zone (not extended). Start back at address and repeat 10 times. When successfully completed, hit some full swing shots and measure wrist angles to see if they are closer to being within range.

Hinging at the Right Time

Hinging is necessary to create lag. The wrists bend toward the thumb when adding radial deviation.

The hinge is necessary for lag, but if it is overdone or done too soon, you may unknowingly add an extension, making it difficult to square the face.

Print Preset Wrist Hinge Drill Preset Wrist Hinge Drill – Step by Step Start at the address position. Position the shaft parallel to the ground and check wrist angles. Ensure the lead wrist is flat or slightly flexed (0° of extension) and the radial deviation is around 14-15°. Check wrist angles: Make sure wrist angles are in the “green zone” (within the correct range of radial deviation and extension/flexion). You should hear or feel feedback if your wrist position is correct. Repeat 10 times: Perform the drill slowly and with control, ensuring you’re consistently in the correct wrist position. After completing the drill, hit a few full shots while focusing on not exaggerating the wrist hinge and letting it occur more naturally.

Reduce Extension on the Downswing

As part of the transition from backswing to downswing, it is important to move the wrist from an extended position to a flexed position.

When your wrist moves more to this flexed position, you can release the lag you have built up effectively at impact.

Most importantly, with a square face and a flexed lead wrist on the downswing you’ll be able to rotate the hips and allow your chest and body to unwind through the golf ball.

This is where additional power and control is added.

Print Motorcycle Drill Motorcycle Drill for Lag – Step by Step Start at the address position. At the top of your backswing, mimic revving a motorcycle throttle with your lead wrist. Transition into the downswing focusing on increased flexion in the lead wrist. HackMotion will track your wrist position and let you know if you are in range. Repeat the motion to build muscle memory.

Additional Drills to Create Lag in Golf

As we have mentioned, the best way to feel and create lag in your golf swing is by working on drills.

Drills will help with both positioning and sequencing required to create lag.

Here are three additional drills to help you create lag in your game.

One-Arm Swing Drill

The one arm swing drill is used to develop feel for lag and minimize lead wrist extension.

It’s a simple drill that you can do with or without the HackMotion.

Print One-Arm Swing Drill One-Arm Swing Drill – Step by Step Swing with your trail arm only, focusing on how the club naturally lags behind your hand. Feel how your lower body has to lead from the top to get the club behind and create this lag position. Use HackMotion to monitor wrist extension and ensure minimal cupping in your lead wrist. Repeat until the motion feels natural, then add your lead hand.

HackMotion Release Drill

The HackMotion release drill helps improve wrist angles and energy transfer at impact.

This drill focuses on getting your fundamentals correct from the 9 o’clock to 3 o’clock position.

Perfect Your Release with HackMotion Fine-tune your release for consistent contact. Start with a short swing to master control before adding power. Explore HackMotion Today

Print Release Drill HackMotion Release Drill – Step by Step Swing back to waist height, pause, and check wrist angles using HackMotion. Transition through impact to waist height on the follow-through, maintaining lag and proper wrist flexion. Each time you do this, ensure you are in the green zone on the HackMotion app. Repeat ten times and focus on a flat or slightly flexed lead wrist throughout the drill.

Sequencing Drill with HackMotion

The correct sequence is essential to maximizing lag in the golf swing.

Use this sequencing drill with HackMotion to master the sequence of pressure shift, hip rotation, and wrist angles.

Print Sequencing Drill Sequencing Drill – Step by Step Take a slow backswing, pausing at the top to ensure a flat lead wrist. Begin your downswing, shifting pressure into the lead foot while rotating the hips. Monitor wrist angles with HackMotion to ensure proper lag creation. Repeat until the sequence feels natural.

Final Thoughts

After analyzing over 1,000,000 golf swings using HackMotion, weve uncovered valuable insights into how wrist action contributes to creating lag. If adding lag and improving your ball striking are your goals, these tips and drills will set you on the right path. Creating Lag in The Golf Swing Key Takeaways If you dont have time to read our guide on understanding lag, here are the most important things to remember. Lag requires proper sequencing pressure into the lead foot, unwinding hips, chest rotation, and a shallowing club. Avoid excessive cupping extension in the lead wrist to prevent an open clubface and ineffective lag. Adding radial deviation wrist hinge during the downswing is ineffective for increasing lag in the golf swing. Body rotation during the downswing is essential for maintaining lag and ensuring a powerful, controlled impact. HackMotion provides real-time feedback and drills on wrist angles to improve lag control and swing performance. What Do I Need to Understand to Create Lag? Lag refers to the angle between the lead forearm and the club shaft during the downswing. For amateurs, it feels like the club trails behind the hands through impact. Maintaining this lag allows for a whip-like action in the clubhead, leading to increased clubhead speed and greater distance. Proper lag also contributes to better timing and sequencing of the swing, ensuring a more efficient transfer of energy to the ball at impact. The Common Myth that Exists about Lag in Golf Lag is not about aggressively increasing wrist hinge the Sergio Garcia myth. Instead, its about sequencing allowing the club head to fall behind the hands naturally as you shallow the club. Many times, when we see faces in pictures or videos of Sergio or any other professional on the downswing, they seem to increase their wrist hinge or radial deviation. This is an illusion. From a down-the-line view, they shallow the club with proper sequencing. Professionals very rarely increase the wrist angle, or their radial deviation, on the downswing. How to Create Lag in the Golf Swing It is crucial to understand wrist movements and their role in creating lag. To improve lag, you must ensure that your wrists are in the right position and that you approach the golf ball with the lead wrist flexed. Proper Wrist Positions to Create Lag Wearing the HackMotion can help you become aware of your wrist positioning during the backswing. The most important wrist measurements are the extension cupping and flexion bowing of the lead wrist. Excessive extension at any point in the swing reduces lag and opens the clubface, leading to weak shots. Static Top Drill in HackMotion Use the HackMotion Static Top Drill to help reduce extension in the backswing. Explore HackMotion Today Print Static Top Drill Static Top Drill  Step by Step Start at the address position. Swing to the top of the swing and stop. Check to make sure wrist angles are in the green zone not extended. Start back at address and repeat 10 times. When successfully completed, hit some full swing shots and measure wrist angles to see if they are closer to being within range. Hinging at the Right Time Hinging is necessary to create lag. The wrists bend toward the thumb when adding radial deviation. The hinge is necessary for lag, but if it is overdone or done too soon, you may unknowingly add an extension, making it difficult to square the face. Print Preset Wrist Hinge Drill Preset Wrist Hinge Drill  Step by Step Start at the address position. Position the shaft parallel to the ground and check wrist angles. Ensure the lead wrist is flat or slightly flexed 0 of extension and the radial deviation is around 14-15. Check wrist angles Make sure wrist angles are in the green zone within the correct range of radial deviation and extensionflexion. You should hear or feel feedback if your wrist position is correct. Repeat 10 times Perform the drill slowly and with control, ensuring youre consistently in the correct wrist position. After completing the drill, hit a few full shots while focusing on not exaggerating the wrist hinge and letting it occur more naturally. Reduce Extension on the Downswing As part of the transition from backswing to downswing, it is important to move the wrist from an extended position to a flexed position. When your wrist moves more to this flexed position, you can release the lag you have built up effectively at impact. Most importantly, with a square face and a flexed lead wrist on the downswing youll be able to rotate the hips and allow your chest and body to unwind through the golf ball. This is where additional power and control is added.

At the top of your backswing, mimic revving a motorcycle throttle with your lead wrist. Transition into the downswing focusing on increased flexion in the lead wrist. HackMotion will track your wrist position and let you know if you are in range. Repeat the motion to build muscle memory. Additional Drills to Create Lag in Golf As we have mentioned, the best way to feel and create lag in your golf swing is by working on drills. Drills will help with both positioning and sequencing required to create lag. Here are three additional drills to help you create lag in your game. One-Arm Swing Drill The one arm swing drill is used to develop feel for lag and minimize lead wrist extension. Its a simple drill that you can do with or without the HackMotion. Print One-Arm Swing Drill One-Arm Swing Drill  Step by Step Swing with your trail arm only, focusing on how the club naturally lags behind your hand. Feel how your lower body has to lead from the top to get the club behind and create this lag position. Use HackMotion to monitor wrist extension and ensure minimal cupping in your lead wrist. Repeat until the motion feels natural, then add your lead hand. HackMotion Release Drill The HackMotion release drill helps improve wrist angles and energy transfer at impact. This drill focuses on getting your fundamentals correct from the 9 oclock to 3 oclock position. Perfect Your Release with HackMotion Fine-tune your release for consistent contact. Start with a short swing to master control before adding power.

Clearing the hips in the golf swing is a mechanism that not many golfers understand. You might hear whispers of it while out on course or from the passerby local “pro” who wants to give you a pointer or two (is that advice ever genuine? Nobody knows…). All that aside, it’s a real thing in golf biomechanics and can significantly improve your shot accuracy when done correctly.

Clearing the Hips in the Golf Swing

Clearing your hips is a term that means opening your hips towards the target upon impact with the ball. The hips initiate the downswing and, if technique/mobility allows, they’ll be facing the target by the time your clubface strikes. Failing to clear the hips during a golf swing could result in reduced power, poor striking of the ball, and an overall inaccurate shot.

Now, there are several things that might change, inhibit, or amplify this sequence from occurring; flexibility, mobility, strength, and genetics/proportions of the golfer, to name a few. When figuring out your golf swing, it can be helpful to look at the pros for guidance. After all, not many of us are having our swings filmed from multiple angles on national television!

There is tremendous variability out on the professional circuit when it comes to clearing the hips. If you watch someone like Dustin Johnson, he has tremendous hip rotation that flows quite loosely through his swing, resulting in a full, open-faced hip angle towards his target when striking the ball.

Compare this to Jon Rahm, who’s hip clearance is almost broken up into two segments during his swing. He has a quick, short backswing, and his downswing is rapid, as well. Upon impact with the ball, his hips will be half open and almost paused. Then, while following through, his hips will complete their rotation and open fully towards the target.

What’s Stopping You From Clearing Your Hips?

Since the golf swing is such a dynamic and sometimes violent action (when going for a particularly long drive, for example), the body has to make a lot of decisions in a very short amount of time.

How do I complete this swing in the way that’s most effective? What do I protect and how? Where will I compromise to find the necessary range and power?

These are all considerations that are happening within the time it takes to blink your eye, regardless of how conscious you are of them.

Some things that might stop the body from clearing the hips in the golf swing include:

Lack of Hip Mobility

If the hips don’t have the capacity to rotate, either passively or actively, then they’re certainly not going to magically develop this ability because you decided to go golfing. As a result, your hips may look and feel very locked up throughout the duration of your swing.

Lower Back Pain

Low back pain is a major problem among golfers. A lot of low back problems originate in the hips because of the relationship between the pelvis and the spine. If you have dysfunction in the back, rotation in the hips will likely be discouraged while swinging.

Poor Technique

The problem might lie simply in how you coordinate your swing. Many people have blocky technique that doesn’t flow well together; the wrong parts moving at the wrong time. Ideally, the hips initiate the downswing and open up fully by the end of the follow-through.

Tips for Clearing Your Hips in the Golf Swing

Let’s move on to how to correct some of these things and get you swinging like never before! Learning how to more effectively clear the hips in the golf swing can give you more clubhead speed, consistency, power generation and accuracy in your shots. A better golf swing makes a better golfer!

Practice the Sequence

Slow your swing down to a snail’s pace, do this with and without a club. Practice moving your body in this order for the backswing:

Hands/arms Shoulders Torso Hips

Then, for the downswing:

Hips Torso Shoulders Hands/arms

Your hips finish the backswing and initiate the downswing when both are executed properly. Try practicing this sequence and making it more fluid with ever-increasing speed and precision. Then, add a ball and start hitting shots until this becomes your natural movement pattern.

Low Back Injury Prevention

Limited mobility in the thoracic spine (mid-upper back), a weak core, weak hamstrings and glutes…all these things contribute to low back pain and dysfunction. This, in turn, discourages movement in the hips for fear of irritating the low back.

Dynamic Golfers offers a comprehensive 6-week Low Back Injury Prevention Program designed to help resolve these issues (and more) by addressing the area from different angles. High quality, follow-along routines that combine strength, stretching and mobility work to bulletproof the lower back and get you moving like never before.

Hip Function & Rehab

In the same manner that lower back problems can impact hip movement, problems in the hips themselves are common in golfers and the general public that make clearing the hips difficult to do. Tight hip flexors from sitting, weak glutes from not doing enough strength training, and overall stiffness from never rotating the hips outside of golf are all very common.

Our platform also has a 6-week Hip Function & Rehab Program designed to deal with any and all types of problems in the hip/pelvic area. Many people experience soreness, ache and pain in the hips before, during, and after golf. This program has helped thousands of golfers worldwide practice and play pain-free. The next one could be you!

hey everybody Danny Maude here thanks for joining us this way I'd like to help you open your hips far more effectively through the impact area why why is it important why do the best ball strikers do this because it generates so much more power it helps you deliver the power and it also helps you to hit it much straighter so getting that open through impact this is one thing you'll see so common with literally every decent player on the planet they're having a wonderful clearance that's what I want you to learn because if you're not doing this if you're finding yourself an impact here where you're very straight on you're gonna end up having a swing that has a very little power and then obviously watch this if there's no space here you end up having to just flick the club with the arm so you'll have impact positions also that look a little bit like this you might even have a chicken wing that starts to come out as a byproducts all of these factors are generating inconsistencies huge loss of power so it's very important that you learn to open the hips that is what I'm going to share with you in this week's training before I get into the video though if you're new to this channel and it's one of your first videos online hopping to the community by pressing that subscribe button and the bell and I notify you every time there's a new video just like this one now let's get started why is it important well I've just given you a brief introduction of why getting the hips open is important watch this if I was to pick up a ball in the most simplest fashion if I pick up a ball and don't move my hips and just throw it like this all I've got is an isolated arm - there's no power in that if I do this and now I've got my hips open I can use my body the entire bow to sling the ball so clearly there's more power involved the other factor is clear you know when you're here if I don't move I getting this flicking motion as I said the club gets unstable it closes it kind of opens it just becomes not nice so I want to show you now how to open those hips first thing the easiest thing to do is this stage number one I'm the question to you is what is your target what is your target most people have so much attention on their golf swings the golf ball keeping their head down that everything's here they do want to hit it down the fairway but the problem is is they've got so much focus and worry about what's going on down here that their body is just don't move from this spot so where you put your attention okay where you put that attention we'll have a but a completely direct impact on what goes on with us hips if your attention is it in this area why would you turn through you know you're going to focus on here you're going to look something like this so I mean it's in the in its extreme there's no ball police at the ball makes make a good swing hit it straight I mean I'm silly exaggerating here but that is going to create a very static motion the golfer who's kind of out there thinking about where they're going to hit it and they're focused there now look there they're there they're moving towards this target as a movement towards its target that is going to naturally encourage more hip motion it doesn't guarantee it but it's going to increase the likelihood that it's going to happen what does guarantee the hips not moving it's too much attention to much obsession too much thinking going on about the swing and concern over where the ball is going to go all right so stage number one make sure that your target draws out the hip turn that's important the target needs to be out there tip number two is I want you to imagine now you let's grab that grab a jam jar a cookie jar and watch this when if to open the lid there are two forces at play here so when you kind of take a a jam jar okay and you kind of twist it you've got opposite forces all the time working yeah like this twist so I want you to imagine now your feet are work is working in opposite directions so if you most people are trying to open their hips that's just out official or whoop that's not what we're doing no-pros tries to open their hips their hips are a byproduct of what goes down on in the feet so when you get yourself set what I want to imagine is you're stood on a gigantic jam jar and what you're going to do is is with this slide here you're going to kind of unscrew the jam jar so you've got a force going this way with your right foot and a force going this way with your left you really feel and imagine the jam just a little bit stuck yeah and you're gonna push it out you really gonna drive it now actually driving that there and you twist to the jam now what happens to the hip it moves the by prett the difference this is the hips not moving because it's some limp Martian it's moving because it's how you're generating that power so what you do you get yourself set make a few swings I want you to imagine on both sides you're gonna turn the jam jar this way this way you're going to turn it there feel that in the feet and then on the way through it you're also going to feel like you're gonna turn the jam they feel lost forces working and I would do this to start off with in a really nice slow fashion turn the jam jar this way and then from here turn it through that way and really sense that ground working artificially moving the hips and trying to get them up and just won't work and if it does it's a fake Martian as professionals we don't want to up in our hips artificially their their opening because it's helping us generate speed into this Martian so have a look at this again we'll get yourself set or stood on that jam jar I've often used the gigantic screw here but I think the jam jar and the opposite forces worked nicely as well so we get ourselves set feel the force is going in opposite directions you've got one force going into there another one's unscrewing here and then again unscrew it here you can really feel those legs working have another look at this

simple nice and easy motions to start with now on to the number three which if you've ever seen the new hotshot at the moment Matthew Wolfe go and check him out sensational player he has an interesting drill which I think could also help you learn the feel of what is open so watch this one thing you'll see Matthew Wolfe do check him out online here's he has a little knee move so when he gets himself set here he actually turns his hips this way and these shoulders slightly open as well now what's he doing here well I think this kind of drill will help you feel what open actually feels like a lot of people don't really know what it's supposed to feel like at the moment they strike a golf ball so if you get yourself set here normally and then just open your hips open your toes a little bit so roughly you want about thirty degrees out will you hit fifteen degrees out mules would be a good guide and the open you get a feeling come back and then just very slowly

you

move into that position so again I'm not hitting this hard in any shape or form at this stage what we're trying to do is teach you and help you learn the feel of this situation so someone have a look at this get yourself set him there we're going to open the hips a little bit here by twisting that jam-jar we're going to open the shoulders a little bit feel what that's like hold it there for a second or two come back to square nice and smooth so if somebody what have we done well the very first thing you need to do in order to try and get those hips working is well first of all understand why you get them working because it's one of the main reasons why you generate power and accuracy when you throw a ball it's how you get everything delivered flowing through to the target you know what leads all that's what creates all this the target you know if you're focused on down here could you've got so many throwing thoughts you're worrying about this worrying about that you're gonna say very fixed to this area and you have these just these isolated motions of just your arm working when you get more target orientated in your intentions out there your body's more likely to move that in itself could be curative that could naturally just improve it but to fine-tune this once you've got that in place then you've got those other couple of exercises this isn't and I've just Artie what I've got to kept my hips open the hips moving are opening our core a result of natural athleticism in the shot no matter your edge imagine that jam jar there's always opposite forces you know to screw the lid off you're kind of moving the jar one way and the lid the other way the same principles true in golf we want to move the hips what's happening is is you've got a force going into the heel of the the lead foot here my left foot and a force going this one I'm twisting the jam jar as I'm doing this my hips are the byproduct open but they open with power they're not just artificially doing this so you get a few balls get that sensation I would take your time with no hitting long shots initially just really sense that and if when they really feel the jam jar going through I'm playing a few short shots to start with together get that sensation and the third and final thing is the Mafia wolf exercise this is person one in life ropes I really like this if somebody who also can get a little bit slightly trim pat myself and and don't always get the hips open this I really really like and that's just a case of getting yourself set here feeling that you're gonna turn the jam jar here you are opening up your hips about thirty degrees holds about fifteen you learn to feel what that's like there hold it come back into Center again no big shot back and away we go and it is as simple as that he says so I hope you enjoyed this training if you did don't forget it a thumbs up and share it with somebody who you think could benefit from something like this maybe this film with some distance and accuracy this simple exercise will really really help and of course look you need to channel press that subscribe button there so I can send you some more videos next week but

generates so much more power it helps you deliver the power and it also helps you to hit it much straighter so getting that open through impact this is one thing youll see so common with literally every decent player on the planet theyre having a wonderful clearance thats what I want you to learn because if youre not doing this if youre finding yourself an impact here where youre very straight on youre gonna end up having a swing that has a very little power and then obviously watch this if theres no space here you end up having to just flick the club with the arm so youll have impact positions also that look a little bit like this you might even have a chicken wing that starts to come out as a byproducts all of these factors are generating inconsistencies huge loss of power so its very important that you learn to open the hips that is what Im going to share with you in this weeks training before I get into the video though if youre new to this channel and its one of your first videos online hopping to the community by pressing that subscribe button and the bell and I notify you every time theres a new video just like this one now lets get started why is it important well Ive just given you a brief introduction of why getting the hips open is important watch this if I was to pick up a ball in the most simplest fashion if I pick up a ball and dont move my hips and just throw it like this all Ive got is an isolated arm - theres no power in that if I do this and now Ive got my hips open I can use my body the entire bow to sling the ball so clearly theres more power involved the other factor is clear you know when youre here if I dont move I getting this flicking motion as I said the club gets unstable it closes it kind of opens it just becomes not nice so I want to show you now how to open those hips first thing the easiest thing to do is this stage number one Im the question to you is what is your target what is your target most people have so much attention on their golf swings the golf ball keeping their head down that everythings here they do want to hit it down the fairway but the problem is is theyve got so much focus and worry about whats going on down here that their body is just dont move from this spot so where you put your attention okay where you put that attention well have a but a completely direct impact on what goes on with us hips if your attention is it in this area why would you turn through you know youre going to focus on here youre going to look something like this so I mean its in the in its extreme theres no ball police at the ball makes make a good swing hit it straight I mean Im silly exaggerating here but that is going to create a very static motion the golfer whos kind of out there thinking about where theyre going to hit it and theyre focused there now look there theyre there theyre moving towards this target as a movement towards its target that is going to naturally encourage more hip motion it doesnt guarantee it but its going to increase the likelihood that its going to happen what does guarantee the hips not moving its too much attention to much obsession too much thinking going on about the swing and concern over where the ball is going to go all right so stage number one make sure that your target draws out the hip turn thats important the target needs to be out there tip number two is I want you to imagine now you lets grab that grab a jam jar a cookie jar and watch this when if to open the lid there are two forces at play here so when you kind of take a a jam jar okay and you kind of twist it youve got opposite forces all the time working yeah like this twist so I want you to imagine now your feet are work is working in opposite directions so if you most people are trying to open their hips thats just out official or whoop thats not what were doing no-pros tries to open their hips their hips are a byproduct of what goes down on in the feet so when you get yourself set what I want to imagine is youre stood on a gigantic jam jar and what youre going to do is is with this slide here youre going to kind of unscrew the jam jar so youve got a force going this way with your right foot and a force going this way with your left you really feel and imagine the jam just a little bit stuck yeah and youre gonna push it out you really gonna drive it now actually driving that there and you twist to the jam now what happens to the hip it moves the by prett the difference this is the hips not moving because its some limp Martian its moving because its how youre generating that power so what you do you get yourself set make a few swings I want you to imagine on both sides youre gonna turn the jam jar this way this way youre going to turn it there feel that in the feet and then on the way through it youre also going to feel like youre gonna turn the jam they feel lost forces working and I would do this to start off with in a really nice slow fashion turn the jam jar this way and then from here turn it through that way and really sense that ground working artificially moving the hips and trying to get them up and just wont work and if it does its a fake Martian as professionals we dont want to up in our hips artificially their their opening because its helping us generate speed into this Martian so have a look at this again well get yourself set or stood on that jam jar Ive often used the gigantic screw here but I think the jam jar and the opposite forces worked nicely as well so we get ourselves set feel the force is going in opposite directions youve got one force going into there another ones unscrewing here and then again unscrew it here you can really feel those legs working have another look at this simple nice and easy motions to start with now on to the number three which if youve ever seen the new hotshot at the moment Matthew Wolfe go and check him out sensational player he has an interesting drill which I think could also help you learn the feel of what is open so watch this one thing youll see Matthew Wolfe do check him out online heres he has a little knee move so when he gets himself set here he actually turns his hips this way and these shoulders slightly open as well now whats he doing here well I think this kind of drill will help you feel what open actually feels like a lot of people dont really know what its supposed to feel like at the moment they strike a golf ball so if you get yourself set here normally and then just open your hips open your toes a little bit so roughly you want about thirty degrees out will you hit fifteen degrees out mules would be a good guide and the open you get a feeling come back and then just very slowly you move into that position so again Im not hitting

somebody what have we done well the very first thing you need to do in order to try and get those hips working is well first of all understand why you get them working because its one of the main reasons why you generate power and accuracy when you throw a ball its how you get everything delivered flowing through to the target you know what leads all thats what creates all this the target you know if youre focused on down here could youve got so many throwing thoughts youre worrying about this worrying about that youre gonna say very fixed to this area and you have these just these

By Bradley Turner Keiser University College of Golf Director of Online Golf Instruction – MBA, PGA

Golf is a sport that demands precision, power, and finesse. Achieving an effective golf swing that produces powerful and accurate golf shots is the ultimate goal of every golfer. To unlock one of the secrets to a great golf swing, the golfer must create an effective kinematic sequence. An effective kinematic sequence is vital in any athletic motion that involves throwing a ball or striking a ball with a stick or racket. The biomechanical phenomenon is at the heart of every powerful golf ball, tennis ball, or baseball strike. In this article, we will define kinematic sequences and highlight the fundamental principles and their significance in improving your game.

Basics of the Kinematic Sequence

Kinematic sequence refers to the sequential movement and timing of body segments during an athletic motion. It plays a crucial role in generating power, accuracy, and consistency in a striking action. The kinematic sequence creates a whiplash effect, with the point furthest from the swing center moving at the highest speed. In throwing a baseball, the fastest-moving segment of the body is the hand, while the fastest-moving segment in the golf swing is the club head. In the golf swing, four important segments influence the kinematic sequence: (a) the hips/lower body, (b) the shoulders, (c) the arms/hands, and (d) the club head.

Kinetic linking is the process by which the energy generated in one part of the body is efficiently transferred to the next. In the golf swing, this is exemplified by the sequential movement of body segments, which begins from the ground up. Let’s further explain the kinetic linking of each phase of the golf swing sequence.

The Backswing Phase of the Golf Swing Sequence

Recent golf swing studies have found that the best players will complete the backswing phase at about the same time. This means that the best backswing sequence will have the hips, shoulders, arms/hands, and clubhead arriving at the top of the swing at the same time. For that to occur, each segment of the swing must be moving at a different speed or rate of acceleration. The hips may turn only 45 degrees, the shoulders a bit more movement at 90 degrees of turn, the arms/hands may move 5 feet on an arc, and the club head will travel about 9 feet on an arc.

The Transition Phase

This is the most important phase of the golf swing for creating an effective golf swing. The transition phase refers to the change from the backswing to the downswing. Just before the completion of the backswing sequence, the best players begin to shift their hips and lower body toward the target. The hips are the first segment to move, and this begins the downswing phase of the golf swing sequence.

The Downswing Phase of the Golf Swing Sequence

You now know the age-old question of what starts the downswing. The hips shift toward the target just before the completion of the backswing. The shoulders begin to follow the hips while the hands begin their journey to impact. The club head should leave the top of the backswing last of the four segments. This chain reaction creates high swing speeds for almost any golfer with adequate physical strength. There are plenty of 12-year-old junior golfers who can smash a golf ball over 250 yards, yet they weigh only 100 pounds! This is possible because of their effective kinematic sequence. At impact, the hips should be about 30-40 degrees open from their starting position. The shoulders will be square to slightly open.

Common Mistakes and Corrections

Here are three common mistakes that destroy the kinematic sequence in a golf swing:

1. No Lower Body Shift in the Transition Phase

This results in a player missing the first step of the downswing sequence. Imagine a professional baseball player throwing a ball. Every pitcher will begin moving forward even before their arm starts backward. A good correction for golfers is to keep most of the pressure (80%-90%) on your lead foot throughout all your short-game pitch shots and wedge shots. Once you get a feel for this pressure on the lead foot, begin to incorporate it into your full short iron golf swings. Eventually, you want to keep the pressure about 50/50 until you approach the completion of the backswing and then shift forward in the transition phase, leading to impact with 80%-90% on your lead foot.

2. Overactive Torso/Shoulder in Downswing Phase

The torso and shoulders work independently in the golf swing, but many golfers tend to turn their hips and torso along with the shoulders all at the same time. This will effectively stop the kinematic sequence and result in slower club head speed and a club path that will create the dreaded slice. The root cause of this can be different depending on the player’s flexibility. To correct this mistake, begin by understanding the conditions of impact by setting your hips 30-40 degrees open to the target line and the shoulders parallel to the target line. Then, begin taking small and slow swings, duplicating the conditions of impact (open hips and square shoulders). You must first learn to do this by making small and slow swings before progressing to bigger and faster golf swings.

3. Casting

Casting is the phrase used to describe the movement of the clubhead too soon at the start of the downswing. Golfers who begin the downswing by first moving the club head are doomed on their journey to good golf. It just will not happen. The root cause of this affliction is often the desire to scoop the ball into the air. A good correction to work on is a pre-impact and impact drill. The pre-impact position is when the club shaft is parallel to the ground, with the butt end of the club positioned near the trail thigh. Both arms should be extended, and hands over the thigh as well. The impact position will have the shaft leaning towards the target by about 8 degrees. You can visualize this by taking an 8-iron and then leaning the shaft forward to match the loft of your 6-iron. This is about 8 degrees of shaft lean. Once again, start with small and slow swings from the pre-impact position to the impact position. Hit very short shots and gradually incorporate them into pitch shot practice sessions before progressing to full swing.

The kinematic sequence is one secret behind powerful golf swings. By understanding the principles of good sequencing, you can work towards improving your golf swing. If you want to hit more powerful, accurate, and consistent golf shots, this is the journey for you. It will require practice, dedication, and likely help from a good golf coach. In the end, you will be rewarded with effortless power and lower golf scores.

Achieving an effective golf swing that produces powerful and accurate golf shots is the ultimate goal of every golfer. To unlock one of the secrets to a great golf swing, the golfer must create an effective kinematic sequence. An effective kinematic sequence is vital in any athletic motion that involves throwing a ball or striking a ball with a stick or racket. The biomechanical phenomenon is at the heart of every powerful golf ball, tennis ball, or baseball strike. In this article, we will define kinematic sequences and highlight the fundamental principles and their significance in improving your game. Basics of the Kinematic Sequence Kinematic sequence refers to the sequential movement and timing of body segments during an athletic motion. It plays a crucial role in generating power, accuracy, and consistency in a striking action. The kinematic sequence creates a whiplash effect, with the point furthest from the swing center moving at the highest speed. In throwing a baseball, the fastest-moving segment of the body is the hand, while the fastest-moving segment in the golf swing is the club head. In the golf swing, four important segments influence the kinematic sequence a the hipslower body, b the shoulders, c the armshands, and d the club head. Kinetic linking is the process by which the energy generated in one part of the body is efficiently transferred to the next. In the golf swing, this is exemplified by the sequential movement of body segments, which begins from the ground up. Lets further explain the kinetic linking of each phase of the golf swing sequence. The Backswing Phase of the Golf Swing Sequence Recent golf swing studies have found that the best players will complete the backswing phase at about the same time. This means that the best backswing sequence will have the hips, shoulders, armshands, and clubhead arriving at the top of the swing at the same time. For that to occur, each segment of the swing must be moving at a different speed or rate of acceleration. The hips may turn only 45 degrees, the shoulders a bit more movement at 90 degrees of turn, the armshands may move 5 feet on an arc, and the club head will travel about 9 feet on an arc. The Transition Phase This is the most important phase of the golf swing for creating an effective golf swing. The transition phase refers to the change from the backswing to the downswing. Just before the completion of the backswing sequence, the best players begin to shift their hips and lower body toward the target. The hips are the first segment to move, and this begins the downswing phase of the golf swing sequence. The Downswing Phase of the Golf Swing Sequence You now know the age-old question of what starts the downswing. The hips shift toward the target just before the completion of the backswing. The shoulders begin to follow the hips while the hands begin their journey to impact. The club head should leave the top of the backswing last of the four segments. This chain reaction creates high swing speeds for almost any golfer with adequate physical strength. There are plenty of 12-year-old junior golfers who can smash a golf ball over 250 yards, yet they weigh only 100 pounds! This is possible because of their effective kinematic sequence. At impact, the hips should be about 30-40 degrees open from their starting position. The shoulders will be square to slightly open. Common Mistakes and Corrections Here are three common mistakes that destroy the kinematic sequence in a golf swing 1. No Lower Body Shift in the Transition Phase This results in a player missing the first step of the downswing sequence. Imagine a professional baseball player throwing a ball. Every pitcher will begin moving forward even before their arm starts backward. A good correction for golfers is to keep most of the pressure 80-90 on your lead foot throughout all your short-game pitch shots and wedge shots. Once you get a feel for this pressure on the lead foot, begin to incorporate it into your full short iron golf swings. Eventually, you want to keep the pressure about 5050 until you approach the completion of the backswing and then shift forward in the transition phase, leading to impact with 80-90 on your lead foot. 2.

https://www.golfdistillery.com/swing-thoughts/impact/hit-through-the-ball-not-at-the-ball/,Hit Through the Ball; Not at the Ball,"Also Known As: “Ball is in the way of the swing; it’s not the target”.

This swing thought gets your mind to focus on making sure you continue your swing after impact. This is in contrast to stopping – more or less – as soon as the club makes contact with the ball.

What it promotes

Swinging through the ball will promote a complete swing acceleration towards the moment of impact. Indeed, the objective is to reach maximum club velocity at the moment of impact.

It will also make sure your swing is full and that it won’t stop shortly after impact but will rather proceed with a complete follow through.

What it tries to cure

Golfers who see the ball as the ultimate destination will undoubtedly start to decelerate shortly before impact. This happens because your mind has been trained to coordinate – more or less – the end of your swing with the wrongly defined final act – the ball. This kind of swing will result in slapping the ball, instead of striking the ball with the full force generated by your body.

Why it works

The golf swing can be broken into many parts, of which impact is only one component and importantly not the last one. Seeing the act of striking the ball as the ultimate act will result in the follow through being constrained.

Indeed, its purpose will be delegated to that of slowing down the club after impact, rather than its full role of promoting the correct positioning of your body into its ideal position.

When is it most useful?

Engraining this swing thought into your entire golf game is recommended. Although there are shots that require you to hold the follow through, it is still recommended that you accelerate into the ball for all shots, including putting. That’s because not following through during putts will lead to very inconsistent results.",[],2018-02-13 18:57:47+00:00,www.golfdistillery.com,"Also Known As Ball is in the way of the swing its not the target.

https://www.performforgolf.com/blog/understanding-golf-swing-path-and-its-impact-on-ball-flight,Understanding Golf Swing Path and Its Impact on Ball Flight — Perform for Golf,"Have you ever wondered why your golf ball consistently curves to the left or right? The answer often lies in your swing path. The direction your club travels through impact influences whether you hit a draw, fade, slice, or hook. In this blog, we’ll explore the basics of golf swing path, how it affects ball flight, and practical ways to refine it for a better game.

What Is a Golf Swing Path?

The swing path is the direction your clubhead travels during the downswing and through impact. It can be categorized into three main types:

1. Inside-to-Out Path

The clubhead moves from inside the target line to outside it at impact. This path is associated with draws or hooks, depending on the clubface angle.

2. Outside-to-In Path

The clubhead moves from outside the target line to inside it at impact. This path often results in fades or slices.

3. Straight Path

The ideal path, where the clubhead travels parallel to the target line through impact, usually leads to straight shots.

How Swing Path Affects Ball Flight

Straight Path

Produces a straight ball flight if the clubface is square.

Inside-to-Out Path

Clubface Open : Results in a push or push-slice.

Clubface Closed: Creates a draw or hook.

Outside-to-In Path

Clubface Open : Leads to a slice.

Clubface Closed: Produces a pull or pull-hook.

How to Identify Your Swing Path

Use Impact Tape or Spray

Apply impact tape or spray to your clubface to see where the ball strikes. This can provide clues about your swing path.

Check Ball Flight Patterns

Analyze whether your shots curve left, right, or stay straight. This indicates your swing path direction.

Video Analysis

Record your swing to visually observe the direction of your clubhead through impact.

Drills to Improve Your Swing Path

Gate Drill

Set up two alignment sticks or tees a few inches apart, creating a “gate” for your clubhead to pass through. This encourages a straighter path.

Path Alignment Stick Drill

Lay an alignment stick on the ground along your target line and practice swinging the club parallel to it.

Tips for Refining Your Swing Path

Focus on Setup

Ensure your stance, shoulders, and hips align with your target. Proper setup lays the foundation for a good swing path.

Work on Rotation

A smooth body rotation promotes a consistent and neutral swing path. Avoid over-rotating or stalling during the downswing.

Practice Consistently

Repetition is key. Dedicate time to drills that address your specific swing path tendencies.

Conclusion

Your swing path is one of the most critical elements of your golf swing. By identifying your current path and practicing the right drills, you can achieve better control over your ball flight. Whether you struggle with a slice, hook, or inconsistency, refining your swing path is a step toward becoming a more skilled golfer.

"https://www.swingtuneup.com/post/weight-distribution-and-impact#:~:text=At%20impact%2C%20the%20majority%20of,reflecting%20a%20well%2Dexecuted%20swing",Mastering Golf: The Art of Weight Distribution and Impact,"The Significance of Proper Weight Distribution:

Proper weight distribution is vital for a stable golf setup, forming the basis for a controlled and powerful swing. As a golfer addresses the ball, ensuring an even distribution of weight between both feet establishes a balanced and athletic posture. This foundation minimizes swaying during the swing, promoting stability and enabling a consistent swing plane.

Key to this equilibrium is the precise distribution of weight from heel to toe and from the inside to the outside of each foot. This not only enhances stability but also provides the golfer with better control over the club, setting the stage for a more controlled swing.

‍

How Weight Transfer Impacts the Golf Swing:

The dynamic transfer of weight plays a crucial role in the evolution of a golf swing, influencing its different phases and ultimately determining the shot's outcome.

1. Backswing:

During the backswing, weight naturally shifts towards the back foot as the upper body rotates.This transfer stores potential energy, creating a coiled position that readies the golfer for the subsequent downswing. Take a look at Wie's foot during the backswing. Both foot are planted to the ground top create as much stability as possible.

2. Transition:

The transition from backswing to downswing marks a critical juncture where weight swiftly shifts from the back foot to the front. This movement initiates the sequence leading to the club's descent and impact with the ball. As Wie prepares for the transition, she shifts her body weight into the outside of her left foot.

3. Downswing:

Powered by the forward momentum generated through weight transfer, the downswing is a decisive phase. The stored energy from the backswing is unleashed, allowing the club to approach the ball with maximum speed on the correct path. As Wie downswings, she transitions her weight from outside of her left foot the left heel and her right heel lifts up naturally.

4. Impact and Follow-Through:

At impact, the majority of weight should be on the front foot (left for righties and right for lefties), ensuring a solid strike and optimal control. The follow-through completes the weight transfer, with the body rotating and weight settling onto the front leg, reflecting a well-executed swing. At the end of the swing, almost all of Wie's weight is on her left foot, which rotates out for more stability, and not much on her right toe.

‍

Shot Outcome:

Weight distribution and transfer significantly impact shot outcomes, influencing accuracy, power, and control. A balanced weight distribution at setup fosters consistency, contributing to improved accuracy. The transfer of weight during the downswing not only generates power but also enables the golfer to compress the ball, achieving a more desirable ball flight.

Proper weight transfer facilitates correct body movement sequencing, reducing the likelihood of common swing faults such as slices or hooks. It promotes a smoother, controlled swing, enhancing a golfer's ability to shape shots and adapt to various playing conditions.

‍

Conclusion:

Weight distribution stands as a fundamental thread in the fabric of golf, weaving through every swing. Mastery of weight transfer is the key to unlocking a consistent and effective swing. By understanding the significance of weight distribution and honing the art of weight transfer, golfers can unravel the secrets to more accurate, powerful, and controlled shots on the course.",[],,www.swingtuneup.com,"The Significance of Proper Weight Distribution Proper weight distribution is vital for a stable golf setup, forming the basis for a controlled and powerful swing.

Backswing During the backswing, weight naturally shifts towards the back foot as the upper body rotates.This transfer stores potential energy, creating a coiled position that readies the golfer for the subsequent downswing. Take a look at Wies foot during the backswing. Both foot are planted to the ground top create as much stability as possible. 2. Transition The transition from backswing to downswing marks a critical juncture where weight swiftly shifts from the back foot to the front. This movement initiates the sequence leading to the clubs descent and impact with the ball. As Wie prepares for the transition, she shifts her body weight into the outside of her left foot. 3. Downswing Powered by the forward momentum generated through weight transfer, the downswing is a decisive phase. The stored energy from the backswing is unleashed, allowing the club to approach the ball with maximum speed on the correct path. As Wie downswings, she transitions her weight from outside of her left foot the left heel and her right heel lifts up naturally. 4. Impact and Follow-Through At impact, the majority of weight should be on the front foot left for righties and right for lefties, ensuring a solid strike and optimal control. The follow-through completes the weight transfer, with the body rotating and weight settling onto the front leg, reflecting a well-executed swing. At the end of the swing, almost all of Wies weight is on her left foot, which rotates out for more stability, and not much on her right toe.  Shot Outcome Weight distribution and transfer significantly impact shot outcomes, influencing accuracy, power, and control. A balanced weight distribution at setup fosters consistency, contributing to improved accuracy. The transfer of weight during the downswing not only generates power but also enables the golfer to compress the ball, achieving a more desirable ball flight. Proper weight transfer facilitates correct body movement sequencing, reducing the likelihood of common swing faults such as slices or hooks. It promotes a smoother, controlled swing, enhancing a golfers ability to shape shots and adapt to various playing conditions.  Conclusion Weight distribution stands as a fundamental thread in the fabric of golf, weaving through every swing. Mastery of weight transfer is the key to unlocking a consistent and effective swing. By understanding the significance of weight distribution and honing the art of weight transfer, golfers can unravel the secrets to more accurate, powerful, and controlled shots on the course.","['The Significance of Proper Weight Distribution Proper weight distribution is vital for a stable golf setup, forming the basis for a controlled and powerful swing. As a golfer addresses the ball, ensuring an even distribution of weight between both feet establishes a balanced and athletic posture. This foundation minimizes swaying during the swing, promoting stability and enabling a consistent swing plane. Key to this equilibrium is the precise distribution of weight from heel to toe and from the inside to the outside of each foot. This not only enhances stability but also provides the golfer with better control over the club, setting the stage for a more controlled swing.

There are a number of misperceptions when it comes to golf swing rotation. A lot of golfers think they are doing it right, but have no good way to check without the help of an instructor. If you think poor shoulder rotation in your golf swing is draining your shots of power, if you’re not sure if you are rotating correctly, or if you think you lack flexibility to get enough rotation in your golf swing, then what follows is for you. We'll go over the do's and don'ts of rotation in the golf swing to help you get increased clubhead speed that comes with a good turn. Getting more body rotation in your golf swing will eliminate lots of inconsistencies in your ball striking by shifting control of your swing away from your arms and smaller muscles and onto your much more consistent larger muscles. In this article we will cover...

Rotation Basics: Turning vs. Tilting

When it comes to golf swing rotation, some golfers tend to cheat by just tilting or swaging. Be it lack of flexibility, or a misunderstanding of how to rotate the shoulders and hips to achieve proper golf swing rotation, there are those who rely entirely on their arms to get to the top of their backswing. The result is a tilt in your body, or worse a collapse of your spine angle forward into what feels like a decent backswing position but which in reality has little or no rotation around your spine. A golf swing without rotation loses its greatest source of power and gets your entire body out of sync, it becomes nearly impossible to get back to a nice square impact position resulting reduced distance and shots that are wildly off target.

To achieve the correct shoulder turn in your golf swing your rotation must include the hips. If done correctly, flexibility hardly factors into the equation. If you're a tilter, you'll be amazed how far you can rotate your shoulders without straining at all if you simply turn your hips as well. A proper shoulder turn involves turning your hips and torso. It relies on big muscles to drive the motion, and big muscles equal big power. By rotating your hips your front shoulder has room to rotate downward, allowing you to maintain your posture and stay on the proper swing plane. If done correctly your shoulders should turn down and under your chin, not out and around. From this rotated position you can return the club back to the ball squarely with more power instead of just throwing or casting your arms to get to impact.

Proper Shoulder Turn

Top 50 Young Golf Instructor and Golf Channel Academy Lead Instructor Devan Bonebrake's swing is perfect for demonstrating proper golf swing rotation.

Both hips and shoulders are turning

Shoulders turning more than the hips

Ideally, shoulders turning 90 degrees away from the target line

Front shoulder turning down and under on the proper swing plane

Feeling tension in the big muscles due to the difference in rotation between the shoulders and hips

Even with a lack of upper body flexibility, if you can turn your hips like Devan you can get your shoulders turned much more relative to your target line creating more power in your golf swing.

Incorrect Shoulder Turn

There's a lot that can go wrong when it comes to rotation in your golf swing. Be sure to avoid the following.

Hips remaining almost square to the target, or hardly rotating

Shoulders that don't rotate as close to 90 degrees as possible

The body collapses or tilts forward instead of turning around the spine

Front shoulder move up and around instead of down and under

No tension in the big muscles with all power being forced to come from the arms

Practice Your Rotation Using Swing Align

It has always been difficult to see your own body’s rotation during your golf swing. It’s one of the more helpful things a second pair of eyes can provide, and a big reason why getting lessons from a golf instructor can help you improve. But without any help, how do you know if you’ve rotated enough in your golf swing? By using Swing Align of course!



The best and easiest way to see the amount of your body’s rotation at the top of your golf swing is the visual from the alignment rods when you wear the Swing Align device. You should also use a ground based alignment tool - like the Swing Junction. Swing Junction allows you to add a small alignment rod perpendicular (90 degrees) to your target line. By turning your shoulders to match the alignment rod on your arms with the perpendicular alignment rod on the ground, it becomes easy to get immediate feedback on how much your upper body and torso has rotated. Remember to rotate your hips to help allow your upper body to rotate more freely!

Ideally, at the top of your backswing, the alignment rod you are wearing on your upper body will be perpendicular (90 degrees) to your target line. You also want the front end of the alignment rod across your arms pointing slightly downward, toward the ground. Getting the rod to be either level with the ground or with the front end pointing slightly down at the top of your swing, indicates that you have turned your shoulders down and under, maintained the proper spine angle and you are on the proper swing plane! Helping you rotate on the proper swing plane is a strength of the Swing Align device.



Go: At the top of your swing the rod across your chest should be perpendicular to your target line. Note: using a rod on the ground outside your back foot placed at 90 degrees serves as a great visual target.

No Go: If the rod does not approach perpendicular to your target line or points up in the air, you have failed to rotate properly.

If you are struggling to get your body fully rotated at the top of your backswing and on the proper swing plane, it could be because you are setting up with your shoulders open to your target line, or during the takeaway your shoulders, arms, or the club is getting out of position. Use the set-up and takeaway content in our Instruction section to check these key swing areas.

Using a Swing Align golf swing trainer to rehearse the correct body positions associated with golf swing rotation works as well, as long as you know what to look for. And you can do this in your house, or garage, or out on the range while you hit balls without another soul around. Seeing and feeling the correct rotation, and knowing how to check the correct amount of rotation, will create a more consistent golf swing that delivers both power and accuracy!

Use the golf tips below in order to improve your golf follow through. This swing sequence occurs immediately after the release and extension and will see your golf swing come to an end.

Hips Should Face the Target at the Follow Through

At the end of the follow through your hips should be square to the target, meaning that they should be facing the target directly.

This is in contrast to an over rotation that see the hips go past square and to the left of the target, which is indicative of over upper body rotation.

It is also in contrast to an incomplete swing that see the hips never reach the point where they face the target.

Related Swing Thought:

Full Follow Through (Don’t Quit At Impact)

While it does occur after the ultimate impact with the ball the follow through is still an integral part of the golf swing and one that should not be sloppily executed.

Indeed, a good follow through and finish position will require a proper journey on the way there. This is in contrast to golfers who simply quit their swings after impact, which highlight deceleration or blocking issues.

Related Swing Thought:

Related Swing Errors:

Weight Should Be (Almost) Entirely Over the Left Foot

While your body weight should be evenly split over your two feet at the start of the swing at address, your finish position at the end of the follow through should see all of it resting on top of your left foot.

This is in contrast to seeing your weight located on your right foot at address and during the follow through, which happen in a reverse pivot swing error.

Indeed, the natural weight flow should move towards the back foot during the backswing and it should move towards the front foot during the downswing, progressively moving towards the front as the swing is completed.

Finally, you should be able to hold your finish in perfect balance until the ball lands, if you needed to. Failure to be able to hold your follow through might be indicative of an off-balance swing. And while that may be apparent in the follow through the balancing issues likely started before impact and is likely costing you in the quality of your golf shots.

Do you feel like every time you try to fix your golf tempo it makes issues in your golf swing worse?

You aren’t alone.

There are issues with “fixing” golf swing tempo that many players run into. We will make golf tempo really easy for you and help you learn how to increase power, speed and control into impact.

One thing you will finally realize is that slowing down your swing is not going to fix your tempo!

Golf Swing Tempo (Key Takeaways)

If you don’t have time to go through each of our drills today, here are the most important tips to understand about golf swing tempo.

A counting drill can help you swing smoothly without overthinking the mechanics.

Use technology like HackMotion Pro to measure your tempo and see if you have the proper ratio and consistency.

Relax at address to reduce tension and enable better transition and rotation.

Take some swings with your eyes closed to work on improving tempo and balance.

When practicing on the driving range, make sure to vary the club you are working with; too many drivers in a row can make it much harder to maintain a consistent and correct tempo.

The ideal tempo for the full swing is 3:1; short game is 2:1.

The Correct Definition of Tempo

Golf swing tempo is almost always referred to as the speed of a golfer’s swing.

It’s not.

The golf swing tempo is the time it takes to get your club from the address to the top of the backswing and down.

Your backswing takes longer than your downswing. During the backswing, you will build up power and potential and then transfer that to the ball at impact.

Take a 2-minute Quiz and Step Up Your Game! 1. What do you want to improve in your full swing?

How to Improve Golf Tempo?

The best ways to improve golf tempo include taking the club back slower, relaxing before you take the club back, and reducing grip pressure.

It’s smart to use drills to improve the golf tempo so that you don’t completely throw off your timing and acceleration through impact.

Here are 6 tips and drills for you to employ in your training regimen.

6 Tips & Drills to Improve Your Swing Tempo

Counting Drill

The easiest swing tempo drill is a simple count exercise where you start counting from the address position until you reach impact.

I like to start this with a few practice swings first because it can be a bit tricky to do it when hitting a golf ball at first.

Counting distracts you from the complexities of your swing mechanics and trains you to develop an identical count with every club.

There is no right or wrong number as long as it is the same for all shots.

For example, I always reach 6 counts from address through to impact. Once I am ready, I address the golf ball and start counting, focusing on nothing else but the numbers. I usually reach the top of my backswing on the count of 5 and strike the ball when I arrive at 6.

3 Drivers, 3 Sand Wedges

The next drill is called the 3 drivers, 3 sand wedges drill, and it is designed to make you develop the same tempo for shots with your woods, irons, and wedges.

All you need to do here is take three swings with the driver and then take three swings with the sand wedge.

I recommend doing 5 repetitions of this drill as a warm-up. Keep in mind these will be full swing sand wedge shots.

Some golfers have no trouble creating perfect tempo with their 7 iron, but when the fairway woods is in their hands they lose all control.

Start Short, Build Long

For this drill, pick your favorite club in your bag. It’s best to use a mid to low iron, which you know you can strike consistently.

I use my 8-iron for this drill, a club I top at 140 yards. Next, I prepare to induce 3 full swing shots, aiming to hit the ball as short as possible and building up to my optimal length of 140 yards.

Since I am swinging full, I need to slow it down significantly to hit the ball shorter than 140 yards, leading to a deliberate tempo.

On the second shot, I increased my swing speed to a happy medium, hoping to hit the ball further than my first shot but not reaching the 140-yard mark.

Finally, I really go after the third ball, trying to get it up to the 140-yard mark with a fast back, the fast through approach.

After I’ve hit the three shots, I examine the results, and it gives me a chance to identify which tempo was more consistent and which one I produced cleaner contact with.

Reduce Grip Tension

Tight grip pressure creates tension in your arms and shoulders, leading to a stiff swing, lack of rhythm, and an inconsistent tempo.

When I talk about grip pressure, I am not referring to a strong, weak, or neutral grip but how tightly you grip the club.

Take a practice swing with a loose grip. You will feel like you don’t have much control. Then swing with a tight grip and notice all of the tension you have in your arms and hands, making it difficult to get proper tempo.

Close Your Eyes

When you try to hit a golf ball with closed eyes, your sole objective turns to get the clubface to the impact point.

When I tried this drill, I immediately stopped thinking about the optimal takeaway and top-of-the-swing position.

Instead, I swing the club, induce rotation, and let gravity do the work.

Over time, it has become easier to execute.

Once you have your bearings in order, visualize the shot once more. Close your eyes and swing. You’ll begin noticing that you’re generating a consistent rhythm and tempo without thinking about it.

You just swing the golf club, rotate your hips, and turn your shoulders, letting gravity do the rest.

Short Swings

For this drill, you will try to hit 10 shots with a 7 iron and just take a quarter swing.

Count one on the backswing and two on the downswing to create a 1-2 rhythm on these shorter shots.

When you get this down, you can start with half swings. At this stage, count 1,2 before reaching halfway through the backswing. As you enter impact, you will say 3. After 10 half swings with a consistent tempo, you can move to ¾ swing and change the count to 1/2/3 on the backswing and 4 through impact.

Why is a Smooth Golf Swing Tempo Important?

Golf swing tempo is important because inconsistent execution costs you speed, power, and control.

If you rush your transition from the top of the swing down, you unload the club faster than intended and lose momentum before the clubface strikes the golf ball.

A smooth golf swing rhythm allows you to control your body and the club to unload it at the optimal time to maximize energy transfer.

Besides a loss of speed, an unstable swing tempo forces your body into an undesirable position, leading to impact and preventing you from squaring the clubface and producing a straight shot.

How do You Measure Tempo?

You can measure your swing tempo using the HackMotion Pro wrist sensor. After every shot, the timing of your takeaway and downswing, along with the corresponding ratio, will be given to you.

For example, if your average backswing time is 1 second and your downswing time is 0.33 seconds, when you divide 1 by 0.33, you get a ratio of 3 to 1 – your tempo.

FAQs

How to slow down golf swing tempo?

You can slow your golf swing tempo by practicing hitting shots that don’t require full distance. For instance, if a 7 iron is your 150-yard club, hit it 125 yards.

Can my golf swing tempo affect my accuracy or distance?

Yes, an inconsistent tempo causes you to unload the golf club too early from the top, losing power, clubhead speed, and energy transfer, impacting your launch and distance.

In addition, inconsistent tempo prevents you from controlling the clubface and squaring it at contact.

Is there a perfect golf swing tempo?

The best golf players produce a tempo ratio of 3:1 from takeaway to impact. Rob Neal, a golf biomechanist, determined this and has worked with hundreds of accomplished professionals.

Do you have the same tempo for each club?

You have the same tempo for each club you take a full swing with in your golf bag. Short game wedge shots are more of a 2:1 ratio.

Summary

Developing a consistent golf swing tempo enables you to unload correctly at the top of the swing and generate optimal power, speed, and control on the downswing.

The optimal swing tempo ratio is 3:1, meaning your backswing is 3 times longer than your downswing.

Dave Tutelman -- January 7, 2012

Every golf instructor I've ever read or heard says you must accelerate through impact . Then they extend this advice to mean that you will hit the ball farther -- more ball speed -- because you are accelerating the clubhead through the ball, than if you were simply coming into the ball at a constant clubhead speed. The first is good instruction. The second is not good physics.



In January 2011, I visited Jim McLean at his headquarters school at Doral (Miami, FL), and had a wide-ranging discussion with him and his staff about physics and golf. One of the more interesting topics was the question of clubhead acceleration at impact. It ""seems obvious"" to everybody who considers the question that an accelerating clubhead will hit the ball farther than a clubhead that is not accelerating. I have never heard or read any instruction that doubts the fundamental truth of this statement. But is it true?



In this article, we are going to consider the questions:

Does ball go noticeably farther due to clubhead acceleration at impact? The answer will be ""no"". So the next question is...

Is accelerating through impact a good swing key anyway? Is it worth teaching as part of the fundamental swing? The answer will be ""yes"".

How much farther -- if at all -- will the ball go? If we are going to seriously consider the question, we have to state the premise less vaguely. We are going to compare:

Ball speed for a clubhead arriving at the ball at V miles per hour with no acceleration. Ball speed for a clubhead arriving at the ball at V miles per hour (same clubhead speed) with a positive acceleration of A . The question is: how much faster (if at all faster) is case 2 ?



Note that I did not ask, ""Is case 2 faster?"" I asked for numbers. Numbers matter! If it is only a fraction of a mile-per-hour faster then, for all practical purposes, there is no difference. It makes no sense to say, ""You get more distance by accelerating through the ball,"" if that extra distance is so small you can't even measure it reliably. However, if it is several miles-per-hour faster, that is a distance gain worth seeking.



(Brief digression on this point. Much of my writing on this site is aimed at custom clubfitters and clubmakers. I have seen so many clubmakers spend a lot of time optimizing one parameter while ignoring or giving short shrift to a different parameter -- one that matters a lot more. Why? Because they know how to measure and adjust -- sometimes with great precision -- the one they spend time on. Old proverb: ""When all you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as a nail."" This article is about instruction, not clubmaking, but we are investigating a similar phenomenon -- focusing on something that makes a tiny difference, perhaps at the expense of something else that is important.)

Simplified analysis #1 - Forces on the ball

Let's use 100mph as the clubhead speed. I have done some computer simulations of good swings, and you might see an acceleration of almost 500 feet per second per second (500 ft/s/s) just before impact. We'll use 500 ft/s/s as the clubhead acceleration for case 2.



Impact lasts 0.0004 second (0.4msec). During that time, the force the clubhead exerts on the ball averages about 1600 pounds. (We need that much force in order to accelerate a 46-gram ball to 150mph in 0.4msec.)



For this analysis, we focus on the forces between the clubhead and the ball. The clubhead is a low-loft driver, so we don't have to worry about a glancing impact; we can use the simple impact formulas.



Case 1:

If the clubhead is not accelerating at impact, that 1600 pounds is the force. Period!



Case 2:

If the clubhead is accelerating, then there is a force on the clubhead making it accelerate. F=ma! We decided to use 500 ft/s/s as the acceleration at impact. When we crank this into F=ma (along with 200g for the mass of the clubhead), we get a force of about 7 pounds accelerating the clubhead.



Let's make the most generous assumption: all the force of the clubhead's momentum and all its accelerating force helps to accelerate the ball. So we have:

1600 pounds due to the clubhead's momentum.

1600 pounds due to the clubhead's momentum. 7 pounds accelerating the clubhead. So the total force accelerating the ball is 7+1600=1607 pounds. How much larger is that than the force in case 1? The increase is 7/1600 = .004 of the total force = .4%



That is less than half a percent. So the acceleration is worth less than an additional 1/2mph of clubhead speed, or an extra distance of less than 1.5 yards. Hardly worth concerning yourself with , unless you are a long drive competitor and pure yards are the way you keep score.



Simplified analysis #2 - Clubhead speed

Let's try another way of looking at it. What would the clubhead speed be immediately after impact , if the clubhead had not lost any momentum from impacting the ball?



Why would this matter? If the ball were not there, we have a speed before impact and another one 0.4msec after impact (i.e.- after separation). The clubhead speed that would be applied to the ball is somewhere between these two. So let's find both.



Case 1:

The clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. That is one of our original assumptions.



Since Case 1 is the case of zero acceleration, the speed 0.4msec later is still 100mph.



Case 2:

Again, by assumption, the clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph.



We have an acceleration of 500 ft/s/s. Therefore, in the duration of impact, the change of velocity is given by the acceleration times the time the acceleration is happening:

Change of velocity = 0.0004sec * 500 ft/s/s = 0.2 ft/sec = 0.14 mph

Velocity 0.4msec after impact = 100 + 0.14 = 100.14mph.



So, out of a clubhead speed of 100mph, the acceleration gives us a boost of only 0.14mph. That's only than a 0.14% gain, and represents an extra 15 inches of distance on the drive. Note that it is the upper bound of the gain in ball speed that you could expect; the actual distance gain will be less. It is even less than Simplified Analysis #1; this one is probably negligible even for a long drive competitor. (Not zero, true. But negligible.)



Bottom Line Our two back-of-the-envelope calculations show distance gains of no more than 4 feet and 1.3 feet respectively, and probably less than that. That's feet, not yards. In the appendix, I have a more detailed analysis that comes closer to an exact answer -- and it is even lower than the two simplified analyses. It only shows 8 inches of additional distance.



For comparison, let's look at just a few other things you might be working on instead of accelerating the clubhead:

Improve your wrist flexibility . Just one degree more of wrist cock is worth a yard and a half of extra distance. (No, not a lot. But almost seven times what clubhead acceleration is worth.)

. Just one degree more of wrist cock is worth a yard and a half of extra distance. (No, not a lot. But almost seven times what clubhead acceleration is worth.) Get contact on the sweet spot . With most drivers, missing the sweet spot a half-inch low on the face will cost ten yards. (From my article on gear effect, and the HotStix data cited.)

. With most drivers, missing the sweet spot a half-inch low on the face will cost ten yards. (From my article on gear effect, and the HotStix data cited.) Work on your core strength . An improvement of just 2% in the strength of your body rotation is worth two and a half yards.

So physics does not back up the notion that accelerating through impact will increase distance. At least not by any amount that you would notice, or would do you any good. Certainly there are better things to worry about, if driving distance were the only benefit of accelerating through impact.



Which brings us to our second question...





Is it good instruction? We just found that it makes no sense to say, ""You get more distance by accelerating the clubhead through the ball,"" if that extra distance is so small you can't even measure it reliably. So why even mention it in instruction? Actually, I am in favor of teaching accelerating through the ball. But not because clubhead acceleration at impact will hit the ball farther. There are quite a few things that are bad physics but good instruction, and this is one of them. Let's look at some reasons that accelerating through impact is a good swing key.



WHAT IS REALLY ACCELERATING? Is it the clubhead, as is usually assumed by teachers telling us to ""accelerate through impact""? If not, is it the hands? The body? Let's look at the possibilities.



Clubhead:

We've already debunked the notion that you get more ball speed from an accelerating clubhead. But there's another reason not to try to accelerate the clubhead -- at least not unless you are doing it right . The act of trying to add clubhead acceleration may itself be deleterious to clubhead speed, if you do it in the obvious way. That seems like a non sequitur -- it doesn't follow. But let's review where clubhead acceleration can come from. We're doing physics here.



The picture at the right shows the two ways the clubhead can still be accelerating at impact. One is good and the other not so good.



Let's start out with the not-so-good one, the upper example. The wrists can be applying a torque to the handle, creating an accelerating force on the clubhead. The shaft must bend backwards to transmit the force. The reasoning is presented in my article on the right-hand hit. Most of that same article examines whether this sort of acceleration provides more clubhead speed or less. The conclusion is that, if applied with exquisite timing, strength, and hand speed, it might give a tiny bit more clubhead speed. But miss out on the timing, strength, or hand speed and it will cost far more distance than could possibly be gained by perfect application.



So you don't want to accelerate the clubhead directly -- by forcing it with the hands and wrists.



The lower example is a more productive way to apply clubhead acceleration through impact. The picture (which I adapted from Andrew Rice's web site) shows the proper position at impact for an iron shot, as exemplified by an impact bag drill. You want the hands leading the clubhead. This implies that the wrist cock is not completely released at impact; the green angle (which I added to Andrew's photo) shows the wrist angle at impact.



If you understand how centrifugal release works (""inertial release"", if you're going to be a stickler about terminology), you will recognize that this position has the clubhead still accelerating; the inertial release has not yet completed. I said this is more productive than accelerating the clubhead with wrist and hands. But why? There are a number of reasons.

Go back to the examples in my article, particularly the ""strobe"" pictures drawn by the SwingPerfect program. You will note that using your hands and wrists to retain the lag (as opposed to forcefully helping release the lag) will actually increase clubhead speed. Also from the examples, note that a side effect is that the wrist cock is not completely released at impact. So -- lo and behold -- you do increase ball speed . But not because you are accelerating the clubhead at impact; it is because you held off centrifugal acceleration until late in the downswing, where it creates the highest clubhead speed. With an iron shot, you want the hands to lead the clubhead for purposes of a solid strike and a negative angle of attack. This becomes less of an advantage with fairway woods and drivers; the usual advice there is to ""sweep"" the ball rather than hitting down on it. But even with woods, you don't want to go beyond a flat wrist at impact. A cupped wrist is a bad idea; the same physical argument says that the clubhead is decelerating if you do that. Which, of course, means that you missed the maximum clubhead speed, which occurred before the clubhead reached the ball. So there are good things that happen if you retain a bit of wrist cock at impact, especially with irons. One of the things that happens is that the clubhead is accelerating at impact -- but that is just a side effect, and doesn't really help you.



Body:

The body turn involves angular velocity and acceleration, so ""accelerate through impact"" might refer to body rotation. In this category, I will lump together legs, hips, trunk -- all the way up to the shoulders. That's because all have to be involved to move the shoulders. The muscles of every link in that chain must either create motion or trasmit it, up from the ground to the shoulders.



What happens if the body does not accelerate through impact? Well, once the ball is gone, anything that happens makes no difference. So, theoretically, acceleration beyond impact is not going to matter. But that's theory, and someone once pointed out to me, ""The difference between theory and practice is bigger in practice than in theory.""



The problem with this theory is the difference between intent (or even ""feel"") and what the body is actually doing.



This relates very directly to accelerating the body turn through impact. A real live human being cannot accelerate the body to impact and not still be accelerating through impact . A golfer thinking only of accelerating to impact is going to quit accelerating before getting near impact. You can't turn off full-body acceleration in .4 milliseconds, probably not even in 100 milliseconds.





intend to accelerate through impact . If there is any reason to want angular acceleration to continue fully to impact (and we will see below that there are good reasons), then a good instructor will teach the golfer the intent of accelerating through impact.



In fact, a good instructor will have the golfer exaggerate... Accelerate well beyond impact. If you have taken a lesson where your swing was video'd, and watched the video afterwards, you know this is true. You may intend to make a particular exaggerated move, you may have felt that you made the move successfully, but it is barely there (if at all) on the video. Much of good golf instruction is getting people to greatly exaggerate a correct move, because it is the only way to get the motion to happen at all. So, assuming we want angular body acceleration to continue up to impact, the swing key to be taught is to accelerate well beyond impact.



Hands and Arms:

I subscribe to golf instruction that says that the hands are moved by the body. But that is not the only theory of instruction out there; I have read books that say things like, ""The arms do the swinging part of the golf swing... The body does not swing. It reacts to the swing."" I may disagree with that, but it might be a productive intent and feel for some golfers. And that makes it valid instruction for those golfers.



But -- make no mistake about this -- physics says that hand and arm motion is caused by body rotation. That is actual, as opposed to intent and feel. So, if we are going to analyze the physics of the swing, the motion of the hands and arms is driven by the body rotation. For the first approximation, we do not have to analyze hands and arms separately, just the body rotation -- which we discussed above. (If we were to refine the analysis, which I won't here, we would next account for the left arm's separation from the body late in the downswing. Still nowhere near ""arms motivating the swing"", but at least there may be some change of the result due to the rotation of the arm not being exactly the same as the rotation of the body.)







CONSEQUENCES OF ANGULAR DECELERATION Above we discussed the angular acceleration of the body. The argument above maintains that, unless you try to accelerate the body's rotation well through impact, you will in fact lose acceleration well before impact. In golf terminology, you will ""quit on the shot."" This has a number of consequences:

Distance actually is lost . This has nothing to do with the clubhead accelerating through the ball, but rather that less acceleration is applied to the clubhead for tens of milliseconds before impact. The clubhead is deprived of some of the accleration it would have had, in order to build up speed at impact. And clubhead speed at impact is what really matters for distance.

The left wrist is cupped , rather than the proper flat or even bowed left wrist. We know that a bowed wrist at impact (or a flat wrist at the very least) is desirable for a solid hit. A cupped wrist, on the other hand, is associated with lost clubhead speed, fat or thin shots, or too-high balloon shots. It is also likely to point the clubface to the left, resulting in a pull or even a pull-hook. (Think about it this way: if the swing plane were perfectly vertical, then a cupped left wrist would add loft. Since the swing plane is not vertical but tilted, some of that ""loft"" turns into a left-facing angle.) To demonstrate the points above, I ran more swing simulations with SwingPerfect. The way you maintain angular acceleration is to apply torque to the body to twist it. With a proper swing, this twists the entire assembly of body, shoulders, arms, and hands. SwingPerfect allows you to adjust the body torque over the course of the downswing -- not a very fine adjustment, but enough to see the effect of modifying the torque-vs-time curve. I ran three different swings for comparison. Here are the results.



The model:

Torque variation during downswing

Clubhead speed

at impact

Wrist angle

at impact

Constant accelerating torque through the downswing, no ""quit"".

The torque is 60 foot-pounds. (For later reference, this is 60*280=16,800 foot-pound-milliseconds.)

107 mph

3º bowed

Our best approximation to the classic ""quit"" scenario:

The same 60 foot-pound of torque for the first 200msec of downswing.

Then the torque drops to 40 foot-pounds for the last 80 msec. 99 mph

6º cupped

Suppose, even with ""quit"", we apply the same total torque-times-milliseconds to the swing as we did earlier to the constant-torque swing. Real swings don't work like that, but let's see how much of the effect is due to the total torque-seconds applied and how much to the fact that some torque is withdrawn late.

A torque of 66 foot-pounds for the first 200msec.

A torque of 46 foot-pounds for the last 80 msec. (66*200 + 46*80 = 16,880 foot-pound-milliseconds, almost exactly the same as the constant-torque swing.)

104 mph

6º cupped

This table confirms the consequences we guessed at above:

If you deprive the downswing of body torque by quitting on it, you lose clubhead speed -- and, obviously, distance. Not only that: the torque late in the downswing (the torque you lose when you quit) is more important than torque early in the downswing. How do we know? Because we still lost 3mph of clubhead speed (about 9 yards) in the third calculation, where the total torque-seconds were the same as the no-quit swing; the torque was larger early in the downswing and reduced during the ""quit"" at the end. Loss of body torque late in the downswing will indeed turn a bowed wrist ( good! ) into a cupped wrist ( bad! ). Let's take one last look at the wrist cupping when the body turn quits coming into impact. Every instructor knows this is true! But the average golfer, and even the average instructor, might not understand why it must be true. It's not complex muscle interaction, it's just physics and geometry. I set up a simulation with exaggerated ""quit"" to illustrate it, using SwingPerfect. Look at the ""strobe"" swing animations here.





The first animation maintains body torque through impact -- that is, it keeps accelerating the body rotation through impact. The clubhead starts with a lot of lag, and really gets moving (develops a lot of momentum) late in the downswing. The clubhead has just about caught up with the hands as it impacts the ball, giving a flat or slightly bowed wrist position at this position.

The second animation starts out the same, and maintains acceleration for the first 200msec of the downswing. Then it gets seriously torque-deprived. That is what we mean by ""quitting on the swing""; we don't apply energetic body turn through the ball. Because we're only human, the loss of acceleration takes effect before we get to the ball -- earlier than the quitter intended. You can see that the hands (the red dots) are slowing down late in the sequence; the red dots are closer together, so we know they are getting slower. Meanwhile, the clubhead (the gray dots) has attained quite a bit of momentum, even after just 200msec. True, not as much as if we had continued to accelerate the rotation, but enough to catch and pass the hands as they slow down. At this point, it's just geometry. The last tens of milliseconds before impact, the slowing hands and not-slowing clubhead result in a cupped wrist -- and all the evils that the cupped wrist brings.

SHORT GAME IMPLICATIONS So far, we have been talking about a full swing. But there are two pretty obvious implications for the short game as well. I haven't worked the numbers on this, but logic and plenty of anecdotal evidence seems to confirm it.

Putting - In putting, the body turn becomes shoulder rock; the swing plane is close to vertical. If you don't continue the shoulder rock well past impact, your wrist will cup. That tends to cause a pull. People who are ""wristy"" putters have learned to time the release to compensate for it. But it is hard to teach, and a low-percentage high-maintenance stroke. Now that we know this little gem of information, putting instruction has adopted a back-and-through motion with as steady a left wrist as possible.

Now that we know this little gem of information, putting instruction has adopted a back-and-through motion with as steady a left wrist as possible. Chipping and pitching - For these shots, wrist cock is negligible to nonexistent, so centrifugal acceleration isn't going to be a factor. What is left is F=ma ; accelerating the clubhead through impact means that the hands, through the shaft, are applying a force to the clubhead. With a clean strike, the accelerating clubhead doesn't matter. But a slightly fat hit will take more than 50% off the distance of a chip or pitch, as opposed to maybe 10% or 20% from a full swing. That is because the clubhead is not just transferring momentum to the ball; it is losing momentum to the ground before it even gets to the ball. When the clubhead strikes a ball, the only resistance is inertia. But the ground is adhered to the earth, and the earth is for all practical purposes an infinite mass. So the club has to administer enough force to cut some turf away from the earth. This is a lot more force than just moving a free-sitting golf ball. So a lot of the clubhead's momentum is lost providing the force needed to cut the turf.



What does this have to do with the accelerating force? Well, force applied to the clubhead can restore some of the lost momentum due to the fat hit. If it is seriously fat, then not much will be restored. But those slightly fat chips will get closer to where you want them if you are accelerating the clubhead all the way through the ball.



Still, like putting or even the full swing, you don't want the hands to create the acceleration, just transmit it from the shoulders. ""Wristy"" chips and even pitches are lower-percentage shots. Unless they are perfectly timed, the usual problems of a cupped wrist are likely to occur: fat hits and sculls. (Think in terms of Steve Stricker's motion; he is one of the most reliable wedge players in golf. He sets the wrist angle, then uses his hands, wrists, and forearms to keep the angle. The acceleration for the swing comes from the shoulders, and continues well through the ball.) BOTTOM LINE ""Accelerate though the ball"" is an excellent swing key, for every shot from a drive to a putt.



But it is better expressed as "" rotate your body through the ball "" (or perhaps ""accelerate moving your hands beyond the ball""), because it is body rotation or ""turning the triangle"" where acceleration through the ball is beneficial. Consciously accelerating the clubhead through the ball (especially if you do it with the hands, wrists, or forearms) will probably do more harm than good.





Acknowledgements First off, I'd like to thank Jim McLean for asking the questions that sharpened the physics issue, to the point that there was something worth writing.



Then Bob Corbo of Simductive Golf got on my case about wrist position and acceleration at impact. He insisted that he and all his students had much more solid ball-striking and never an over-the-top if the wrist is flat or bowed from the transition through well past impact. He challenged me to explain why. It was clear it had something to do with acceleration.







Appendix - More exact analysis Here is a more detailed analysis of the physics of impact. We are going to look at the equations for momentum transfer from clubhead to ball, and see how that is affected by an accelerating clubhead. If you're not into the math and physics of it, you can skip the details below. Here's a peek at the ending: The distance gain you can expect from an accelerating clubhead is less than a foot -- only 8 inches.

As in the simplified analyses, we will compare:

( case 1 ) clubhead impacts ball at constant speed of 100mph.

( case 2 ) clubhead impacts ball at speed of 100mph, while accelerating at 500feet/sec/sec.

These two cases will be compared, to test the value of clubhead acceleration in creating ball speed.



We'll start with notation. The computation will be done using MKS units (meter-kilogram-second), to be sure we aren't making mistakes in units. We will convert back to the units we recognize (like pounds, miles per hour, etc) when we want to get a feel for what's going on.

U denotes a velocity just before impact.

V denotes a velocity just after impact. Specifically:



U h = Clubhead speed just before impact = 100mph = 44.7 m/s U b = Ball speed just before impact = 0 V h = Clubhead speed just after impact (we will compute) V b = Ball speed just after impact (we will compute) M

= Clubhead mass = 200g = .2 Kg m

= Ball mass = 46g = .046 Kg m/M

= .046/.2 = 0.23 (Listed here because we use this ratio a lot) C

= Coefficient of restitution = .83 (max allowed by USGA/R&A)



CASE 1 - NO ACCELERATION OF CLUBHEAD INTO BALL This is a simple momentum transfer problem. The clubhead impacts the ball, and transfers some of its momentum to the ball. Since the clubhead is more than four times as heavy as the ball, it will still retain some considerable speed after impact -- though a lot less than before impact. The total momentum of clubhead plus ball remains the same after as it was before. And, of course, the total energy after impact will be less, because the COR is less than 1. Some energy will be lost to internal friction during the collision (mostly friction inside the ball, but a little in the clubface).



We will start with the well-known general equations for a simple lossy impact.



V h = C m (U b -U h ) + M U h + m U b

M+m





V b = C M (U h -U b ) + M U h + m U b

M+m

But we know the ball starts at rest ( U b = 0), so we can simplify to:



V h = M U h - C m U h

M+m

= U h

1 - C m/M

1 + m/M









V b = C M U h + M U h

M+m = U h

1 + C

1 + m/M

That last equation should look familiar; we use it all the time to compute ball speed.



The first equation is something we don't see as often; it gives the clubhead velocity after impact. It will be slower, because the clubhead has transferred a bunch of momentum to the ball. If we use numerical values we originally assigned for m , M , and C , the equations become:





V h

= U h

1 - (.83 * .23)

1 + .23

= Uh * .66









V b

= U h

1 + .83

1 + .23 = Uh * 1.49



Again, the second equation is familiar; it is the maximum legal ""smash factor"" for a 200g driver head. It is generally thought of as 1.5, which is a very close rounding of 1.49.



The first says that the clubhead loses about a third of its speed in impact.



Now it's easy to solve for Vb and Vh, the ball and clubhead speeds after impact:



V b = 149 mph = 66.6 m/s



V h = 66 mph = 29.5 m/s



So now we know how much the head slows down, and the ball speeds up, during impact.



While we're here, let's look at the force and momentum involved .



Momentum is interesting to physicists at least in part because it relates force, time, velocity, and mass. Here's how:



Everybody know's Newton's second law: F = ma



One component of that is acceleration, which is a change of velocity over time. Physicists and mathematicians usually refer to such a change as a ""delta"". So a change of velocity would be ""delta V"" or ΔV . So:



F = ma = m

ΔV

t



Or



Ft = m Δ V



The right side is the change of momentum. The left side is called ""impulse"", and the relationship is: Impulse equals momentum change . Physicists and mathematicians have a more general view of impulse; it does not require a constant force, as our equation does. But we prove below that, for our calculations, a constant force gives exactly the same answer as if we plotted the exact buildup and decay of force during the collision between clubhead and ball.



Let's use this, plus our results above, to compute first the momentum change for clubhead and ball, then the force the clubhead exerts on the ball to cause the momentum change:



Clubhead : m Δ V = M (U h - V h ) = .2 (44.7-29.5) = 3.0



Ball : m Δ V = m Vb = .046 * 66.6 = 3.0



Good, they're the same! That means we did the arithmetic right, because the law of conservation of momentum says: any momentum gained by the ball must be lost by the clubhead. And it was.



Now for the forces. From above, impulse = momentum change:



Ft = m Δ V



We know that the momentum change is 3.0 Kg-meters/sec, so:



Momentum change = Impulse = Ft = 3.0



we also know that t = .0004, so:



.0004 F = 3.0



F = 7500 Newtons (N) = 1686 pounds



So the average force between clubhead and ball during impact is 1686 pounds.



CASE 2: CLUBHEAD ACCELERATES INTO BALL In a good swing, the clubhead can accelerate into the ball by as much as 500 feet per second per second. (In MKS units, that's 152.4 meters per second per second.) The only reason clubhead acceleration might matter for distance is that there is an extra force added to the momentum transfer that we had in case 1. That force is whatever force is accelerating the clubhead. If it was accelerating the clubhead coming into impact, then it is continuing to push the clubhead during impact -- and that is where any benefit will derive.



Let's use F=ma to see how much force is accelerating the clubhead just before impact:



F = ma = .2 * 152.4 = 30.5 N = 6.85 pounds



This force will increase the momentum of the whole system during impact -- both the clubhead and the ball it is ""pushing"". For the .0004 seconds that the clubhead and ball are in contact, we will have an extra 7 pounds of force (we'll round 6.85 up) accelerating the whole 246-gram mass of clubhead+ball. Let's see what that does to the final velocities. (The calculations below are in MKS units.)



F t = (M + m) Δ V



Δ V = F t

M + m

=

30.5 * .0004

.200 + .046

= .0496 m/s = 0.11mph



So it has added a whole .11 mph to the combination of clubhead and ball by the time the ball separates from the clubhead. That means:



Clubhead speed after impact = 66 + .11 = 66.11 mph Ball speed after impact = 149 + .11 = 149.11 mph

This is not much of a gain in yardage. Using the rule of thumb ' 1 additional mph of ball speed gives 2 additional yards ', we have increased the distance by 0.22 yards, or about 8 inches.



Why is this less than the rough calculations, the simplified analyses, in the main body of the article? Because each simplified analysis was a 'back of the envelope' calculation that I could do in a couple of minutes. Any time you make a rough calculation instead of a complete analysis, you must make lots of assumptions. In each case, I had chosen an assumption to make acceleration look important. I did that because I suspected the answer would come out, ""It's not that important."" I didn't want my assumptions challenged as the reason it didn't look important, so the assumptions were all in favor of acceleration. Note that, even so, acceleration didn't seem all that important. But when I replaced assumptions with actual calculation, the results showed acceleration to be even less important.

DEPENDENCE ON FORCE PROFILE DURING IMPACT

One last point: These calculations are based on a constant force -- the average force -- during contact between clubhead and ball. One last point: These calculations are based on a constant force -- the average force -- during contact between clubhead and ball. The blue force-vs-time profile in the picture shows this; during impact, the force is some constant value, and it is zero all other times. Obviously this is contrary to fact; the force starts small, increases as the ball compresses, and decreases as the ball releases and leaves the clubface. In other words, the red force-vs-time profile is what is really happening.



So we need to show that it doesn't matter; any force profile that gives the same average force will give the same final velocities. (""The same average force"" means the same area under the profile curve.)



Below is a quick proof, in case you're interested. It involves a bit of integral calculus, but very easy and basic stuff.



The only place we make assumptions about the force profile is where we use 'impulse equals momentum change'. So let's generalize that, using F(t) for force as a function of time.



That means we re-express F t = M Δ V as F(t) dt = M dV where d means an infinitesimal delta.



To find the actual change in velocity , we need to integrate.



∫ F(t) dt = M Δ V



or , solving for Δ V :



Δ V = 1/M * ∫ F(t)dt (Equation #1)



Equation #1 gives the change in velocity if we used the actual force profile F(t) : start small, increase to a peak, then fall off again. In order to compute Δ V directly from physical principles, we would need the actual force function F(t) , and then use integration to find the area under the curve.



But, in our calculations above, we used the average force over the duration of impact, F av . Is this legitimate? Does it give the same answer?



To find out, we have to see how the average force F av is computed? If the total time is T (in our case, 0.4 milliseconds), then the average is computed as:



F av = 1/T * ∫ F(t)dt



In our presumably ""exact"" analysis, we used F av to compute Δ V using the formula:



Δ V = F av * T / M



Let's plug in for F av the time-dependent formula for F av using integration. So Δ V becomes:



Δ V = 1/T * ∫ F(t)dt * T / M



Δ V = 1/M ∫ F(t)dt



That's exactly the same as Equation #1 above. Which says we get the same change in ball speed whether we use the average force or the actual force profile.

",['Dave Tutelman'],,tutelman.com,"Accelerating Through Impact Mandate or Myth Dave Tutelman -- January 7, 2012 Every golf instructor Ive ever read or heard says you must accelerate through impact . Then they extend this advice to mean that you will hit the ball farther -- more ball speed -- because you are accelerating the clubhead through the ball, than if you were simply coming into the ball at a constant clubhead speed. The first is good instruction. The second is not good physics. In January 2011, I visited Jim McLean at his headquarters school at Doral Miami, FL, and had a wide-ranging discussion with him and his staff about physics and golf. One of the more interesting topics was the question of clubhead acceleration at impact. It seems obvious to everybody who considers the question that an accelerating clubhead will hit the ball farther than a clubhead that is not accelerating. I have never heard or read any instruction that doubts the fundamental truth of this statement. But is it true? In this article, we are going to consider the questions Does ball go noticeably farther due to clubhead acceleration at impact? The answer will be no. So the next question is... Is accelerating through impact a good swing key anyway? Is it worth teaching as part of the fundamental swing? The answer will be yes. How much farther -- if at all -- will the ball go? If we are going to seriously consider the question, we have to state the premise less vaguely. We are going to compare Ball speed for a clubhead arriving at the ball at V miles per hour with no acceleration. Ball speed for a clubhead arriving at the ball at V miles per hour same clubhead speed with a positive acceleration of A . The question is how much faster if at all faster is case 2 ? Note that I did not ask, Is case 2 faster? I asked for numbers. Numbers matter! If it is only a fraction of a mile-per-hour faster then, for all practical purposes, there is no difference. It makes no sense to say, You get more distance by accelerating through the ball, if that extra distance is so small you cant even measure it reliably. However, if it is several miles-per-hour faster, that is a distance gain worth seeking. Brief digression on this point. Much of my writing on this site is aimed at custom clubfitters and clubmakers. I have seen so many clubmakers spend a lot of time optimizing one parameter while ignoring or giving short shrift to a different parameter -- one that matters a lot more. Why? Because they know how to measure and adjust -- sometimes with great precision -- the one they spend time on. Old proverb When all you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as a nail. This article is about instruction, not clubmaking, but we are investigating a similar phenomenon -- focusing on something that makes a tiny difference, perhaps at the expense of something else that is important. Simplified analysis 1 - Forces on the ball Lets use 100mph as the clubhead speed. I have done some computer simulations of good swings, and you might see an acceleration of almost 500 feet per second per second 500 ftss just before impact. Well use 500 ftss as the clubhead acceleration for case 2. Impact lasts 0.0004 second 0.4msec. During that time, the force the clubhead exerts on the ball averages about 1600 pounds. We need that much force in order to accelerate a 46-gram ball to 150mph in 0.4msec. For this analysis, we focus on the forces between the clubhead and the ball. The clubhead is a low-loft driver, so we dont have to worry about a glancing impact we can use the simple impact formulas. Case 1 If the clubhead is not accelerating at impact, that 1600 pounds is the force. Period! Case 2 If the clubhead is accelerating, then there is a force on the clubhead making it accelerate. Fma! We decided to use 500 ftss as the acceleration at impact. When we crank this into Fma along with 200g for the mass of the clubhead, we get a force of about 7 pounds accelerating the clubhead. Lets make the most generous assumption all the force of the clubheads momentum and all its accelerating force helps to accelerate the ball. So we have 1600 pounds due to the clubheads momentum. 1600 pounds due to the clubheads momentum. 7 pounds accelerating the clubhead. So the total force accelerating the ball is 716001607 pounds. How much larger is that than the force in case 1? The increase is 71600  .004 of the total force  .4 That is less than half a percent. So the acceleration is worth less than an additional 12mph of clubhead speed, or an extra distance of less than 1.5 yards. Hardly worth concerning yourself with , unless you are a long drive competitor and pure yards are the way you keep score. Simplified analysis 2 - Clubhead speed Lets try another way of looking at it. What would the clubhead speed be immediately after impact , if the clubhead had not lost any momentum from impacting the ball? Why would this matter? If the ball were not there, we have a speed before impact and another one 0.4msec after impact i.e.- after separation. The clubhead speed that would be applied to the ball is somewhere between these two. So lets find both. Case 1 The clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. That is one of our original assumptions. Since Case 1 is the case of zero acceleration, the speed 0.4msec later is still 100mph. Case 2 Again, by assumption, the clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. We have an acceleration of 500 ftss. Therefore, in the duration of impact, the change of velocity is given by the acceleration times the time the acceleration is happening Change of velocity  0.0004sec  500 ftss  0.2 ftsec  0.14 mph Velocity 0.4msec after impact  100  0.14  100.14mph. So, out of a clubhead speed of 100mph, the acceleration gives us a boost of only 0.14mph. Thats only than a 0.14 gain, and represents an extra 15 inches of distance on the drive. Note that it is the upper bound of the gain in ball speed that you could expect the actual distance gain will be less. It is even less than Simplified Analysis 1 this one is probably negligible even for a long drive competitor. Not zero, true. But negligible. Bottom Line Our two back-of-the-envelope calculations show distance gains of no more than 4 feet and 1.3 feet respectively, and probably less than that. Thats feet, not yards. In the appendix, I have a more detailed analysis that comes closer to an exact answer -- and it is even lower than the two simplified analyses. It only shows 8 inches of additional distance. For comparison, lets look at just a few other things you might be working on instead of accelerating the clubhead Improve your wrist flexibility .

With most drivers, missing the sweet spot a half-inch low on the face will cost ten yards. From my article on gear effect, and the HotStix data cited. Work on your core strength . An improvement of just 2 in the strength of your body rotation is worth two and a half yards. So physics does not back up the notion that accelerating through impact will increase distance. At least not by any amount that you would notice, or would do you any good. Certainly there are better things to worry about, if driving distance were the only benefit of accelerating through impact. Which brings us to our second question... Is it good instruction? We just found that it makes no sense to say, You get more distance by accelerating the clubhead through the ball, if that extra distance is so small you cant even measure it reliably. So why even mention it in instruction? Actually, I am in favor of teaching accelerating through the ball. But not because clubhead acceleration at impact will hit the ball farther. There are quite a few things that are bad physics but good instruction, and this is one of them. Lets look at some reasons that accelerating through impact is a good swing key. WHAT IS REALLY ACCELERATING? Is it the clubhead, as is usually assumed by teachers telling us to accelerate through impact? If not, is it the hands? The body? Lets look at the possibilities. Clubhead Weve already debunked the notion that you get more ball speed from an accelerating clubhead. But theres another reason not to try to accelerate the clubhead -- at least not unless you are doing it right . The act of trying to add clubhead acceleration may itself be deleterious to clubhead speed, if you do it in the obvious way. That seems like a non sequitur -- it doesnt follow. But lets review where clubhead acceleration can come from. Were doing physics here. The picture at the right shows the two ways the clubhead can still be accelerating at impact. One is good and the other not so good. Lets start out with the not-so-good one, the upper example. The wrists can be applying a torque to the handle, creating an accelerating force on the clubhead. The shaft must bend backwards to transmit the force. The reasoning is presented in my article on the right-hand hit. Most of that same article examines whether this sort of acceleration provides more clubhead speed or less. The conclusion is that, if applied with exquisite timing, strength, and hand speed, it might give a tiny bit more clubhead speed. But miss out on the timing, strength, or hand speed and it will cost far more distance than could possibly be gained by perfect application. So you dont want to accelerate the clubhead directly -- by forcing it with the hands and wrists. The lower example is a more productive way to apply clubhead acceleration through impact. The picture which I adapted from Andrew Rices web site shows the proper position at impact for an iron shot, as exemplified by an impact bag drill. You want the hands leading the clubhead. This implies that the wrist cock is not completely released at impact the green angle which I added to Andrews photo shows the wrist angle at impact. If you understand how centrifugal release works inertial release, if youre going to be a stickler about terminology, you will recognize that this position has the clubhead still accelerating the inertial release has not yet completed. I said this is more productive than accelerating the clubhead with wrist and hands. But why? There are a number of reasons. Go back to the examples in my article, particularly the strobe pictures drawn by the SwingPerfect program. You will note that using your hands and wrists to retain the lag as opposed to forcefully helping release the lag will actually increase clubhead speed. Also from the examples, note that a side effect is that the wrist cock is not completely released at impact. So -- lo and behold -- you do increase ball speed . But not because you are accelerating the clubhead at impact it is because you held off centrifugal acceleration until late in the downswing, where it creates the highest clubhead speed. With an iron shot, you want the hands to lead the clubhead for purposes of a solid strike and a negative angle of attack. This becomes less of an advantage with fairway woods and drivers the usual advice there is to sweep the ball rather than hitting down on it. But even with woods, you dont want to go beyond a flat wrist at impact. A cupped wrist is a bad idea the same physical argument says that the clubhead is decelerating if you do that. Which, of course, means that you missed the maximum clubhead speed, which occurred before the clubhead reached the ball. So there are good things that happen if you retain a bit of wrist cock at impact, especially with irons. One of the things that happens is that the clubhead is accelerating at impact -- but that is just a side effect, and doesnt really help you. Body The body turn involves angular velocity and acceleration, so accelerate through impact might refer to body rotation. In this category, I will lump together legs, hips, trunk -- all the way up to the shoulders. Thats because all have to be involved to move the shoulders. The muscles of every link in that chain must either create motion or trasmit it, up from the ground to the shoulders. What happens if the body does not accelerate through impact? Well, once the ball is gone, anything that happens makes no difference. So, theoretically, acceleration beyond impact is not going to matter. But thats theory, and someone once pointed out to me, The difference between theory and practice is bigger in practice than in theory. The problem with this theory is the difference between intent or even feel and what the body is actually doing. This relates very directly to accelerating the body turn through impact. A real live human being cannot accelerate the body to impact and not still be accelerating through impact . A golfer thinking only of accelerating to impact is going to quit accelerating before getting near impact. You cant turn off full-body acceleration in .4 milliseconds, probably not even in 100 milliseconds. intend to accelerate through impact . If there is any reason to want angular acceleration to continue fully to impact and we will see below that there are good reasons, then a good instructor will teach the golfer the intent of accelerating through impact. In fact, a good instructor will have the golfer exaggerate... Accelerate well beyond impact. If you have taken a lesson where your swing was videod, and watched the video afterwards, you know this is true. You may intend to make a particular exaggerated move, you may have felt that you made the move successfully, but it is barely there if at all on the video. Much of good golf instruction is getting people to greatly exaggerate a correct move, because it is the only way to get the motion to happen at all. So, assuming we want angular body acceleration to continue up to impact, the swing key to be taught is to accelerate well beyond impact. Hands and Arms I subscribe to golf instruction that says that the hands are moved by the body. But that is not the only theory of instruction out there I have read books that say things like, The arms do the swinging part of the golf swing... The body does not swing. It reacts to the swing. I may disagree with that, but it might be a productive intent and feel for some golfers. And that makes it valid instruction for those golfers. But -- make no mistake about this -- physics says that hand and arm motion is caused by body rotation. That is actual, as opposed to intent and feel. So, if we are going to analyze the physics of the swing, the motion of the hands and arms is driven by the body rotation. For the first approximation, we do not have to analyze hands and arms separately, just the body rotation -- which we discussed above. If we were to refine the analysis, which I wont here, we would next account for the left arms separation from the body late in the downswing. Still nowhere near arms motivating the swing, but at least there may be some change of the result due to the rotation of the arm not being exactly the same as the rotation of the body. CONSEQUENCES OF ANGULAR DECELERATION Above we discussed the angular acceleration of the body. The argument above maintains that, unless you try to accelerate the bodys rotation well through impact, you will in fact lose acceleration well before impact. In golf terminology, you will quit on the shot. This has a number of consequences Distance actually is lost . This has nothing to do with the clubhead accelerating through the ball, but rather that less acceleration is applied to the clubhead for tens of milliseconds before impact. The clubhead is deprived of some of the accleration it would have had, in order to build up speed at impact. And clubhead speed at impact is what really matters for distance. The left wrist is cupped , rather than the proper flat or even bowed left wrist. We know that a bowed wrist at impact or a flat wrist at the very least is desirable for a solid hit. A cupped wrist, on the other hand, is associated with lost clubhead speed, fat or thin shots, or too-high balloon shots. It is also likely to point the clubface to the left, resulting in a pull or even a pull-hook. Think about it this way if the swing plane were perfectly vertical, then a cupped left wrist would add loft. Since the swing plane is not vertical but tilted, some of that loft turns into a left-facing angle. To demonstrate the points above, I ran more swing simulations with SwingPerfect. The way you maintain angular acceleration is to apply torque to the body to twist it. With a proper swing, this twists the entire assembly of body, shoulders, arms, and hands. SwingPerfect allows you to adjust the body torque over the course of the downswing -- not a very fine adjustment, but enough to see the effect of modifying the torque-vs-time curve. I ran three different swings for comparison. Here are the results. The model Torque variation during downswing Clubhead speed at impact Wrist angle at impact Constant accelerating torque through the downswing, no quit. The torque is 60 foot-pounds. For later reference, this is 6028016,800 foot-pound-milliseconds. 107 mph 3º bowed Our best approximation to the classic quit scenario The same 60 foot-pound of torque for the first 200msec of downswing. Then the torque drops to 40 foot-pounds for the last 80 msec. 99 mph 6º cupped Suppose, even with quit, we apply the same total torque-times-milliseconds to the swing as we did earlier to the constant-torque swing. Real swings dont work like that, but lets see how much of the effect is due to the total torque-seconds applied and how much to the fact that some torque is withdrawn late. A torque of 66 foot-pounds for the first 200msec. A torque of 46 foot-pounds for the last 80 msec. 66200  4680  16,880 foot-pound-milliseconds, almost exactly the same as the constant-torque swing. 104 mph 6º cupped This table confirms the consequences we guessed at above If you deprive the downswing of body torque by quitting on it, you lose clubhead speed -- and, obviously, distance. Not only that the torque late in the downswing the torque you lose when you quit is more important than torque early in the downswing. How do we know? Because we still lost 3mph of clubhead speed about 9 yards in the third calculation, where the total torque-seconds were the same as the no-quit swing the torque was larger early in the downswing and reduced during the quit at the end. Loss of body torque late in the downswing will indeed turn a bowed wrist  good!  into a cupped wrist  bad! . Lets take one last look at the wrist cupping when the body turn quits coming into impact. Every instructor knows this is true! But the average golfer, and even the average instructor, might not understand why it must be true. Its not complex muscle interaction, its just physics and geometry. I set up a simulation with exaggerated quit to illustrate it, using SwingPerfect. Look at the strobe swing animations here. The first animation maintains body torque through impact -- that is, it keeps accelerating the body rotation through impact. The clubhead starts with a lot of lag, and really gets moving develops a lot of momentum late in the downswing. The clubhead has just about caught up with the hands as it impacts the ball, giving a flat or slightly bowed wrist position at this position. The second animation starts out the same, and maintains acceleration for the first 200msec of the downswing. Then it gets seriously torque-deprived. That is what we mean by quitting on the swing we dont apply energetic body turn through the ball. Because were only human, the loss of acceleration takes effect before we get to the ball -- earlier than the quitter intended. You can see that the hands the red dots are slowing down late in the sequence the red dots are closer together, so we know they are getting slower. Meanwhile, the clubhead the gray dots has attained quite a bit of momentum, even after just 200msec. True, not as much as if we had continued to accelerate the rotation, but enough to catch and pass the hands as they slow down. At this point, its just geometry. The last tens of milliseconds before impact, the slowing hands and not-slowing clubhead result in a cupped wrist -- and all the evils that the cupped wrist brings. SHORT GAME IMPLICATIONS So far, we have been talking about a full swing. But there are two pretty obvious implications for the short game as well. I havent worked the numbers on this, but logic and plenty of anecdotal evidence seems to confirm it. Putting - In putting, the body turn becomes shoulder rock the swing plane is close to vertical. If you dont continue the shoulder rock well past impact, your wrist will cup. That tends to cause a pull. People who are wristy putters have learned to time the release to compensate for it. But it is hard to teach, and a low-percentage high-maintenance stroke. Now that we know this little gem of information, putting instruction has adopted a back-and-through motion with as steady a left wrist as possible. - In putting, the body turn becomes shoulder rock the swing plane is close to vertical.

But it is hard to teach, and a low-percentage high-maintenance stroke. Now that we know this little gem of information, putting instruction has adopted a back-and-through motion with as steady a left wrist as possible. Chipping and pitching - For these shots, wrist cock is negligible to nonexistent, so centrifugal acceleration isnt going to be a factor. What is left is Fma  accelerating the clubhead through impact means that the hands, through the shaft, are applying a force to the clubhead. With a clean strike, the accelerating clubhead doesnt matter. But a slightly fat hit will take more than 50 off the distance of a chip or pitch, as opposed to maybe 10 or 20 from a full swing. That is because the clubhead is not just transferring momentum to the ball it is losing momentum to the ground before it even gets to the ball. When the clubhead strikes a ball, the only resistance is inertia. But the ground is adhered to the earth, and the earth is for all practical purposes an infinite mass. So the club has to administer enough force to cut some turf away from the earth. This is a lot more force than just moving a free-sitting golf ball. So a lot of the clubheads momentum is lost providing the force needed to cut the turf. What does this have to do with the accelerating force? Well, force applied to the clubhead can restore some of the lost momentum due to the fat hit. If it is seriously fat, then not much will be restored. But those slightly fat chips will get closer to where you want them if you are accelerating the clubhead all the way through the ball. Still, like putting or even the full swing, you dont want the hands to create the acceleration, just transmit it from the shoulders. Wristy chips and even pitches are lower-percentage shots. Unless they are perfectly timed, the usual problems of a cupped wrist are likely to occur fat hits and sculls. Think in terms of Steve Strickers motion he is one of the most reliable wedge players in golf. He sets the wrist angle, then uses his hands, wrists, and forearms to keep the angle. The acceleration for the swing comes from the shoulders, and continues well through the ball. BOTTOM LINE Accelerate though the ball is an excellent swing key, for every shot from a drive to a putt. But it is better expressed as  rotate your body through the ball  or perhaps accelerate moving your hands beyond the ball, because it is body rotation or turning the triangle where acceleration through the ball is beneficial. Consciously accelerating the clubhead through the ball especially if you do it with the hands, wrists, or forearms will probably do more harm than good. Acknowledgements First off, Id like to thank Jim McLean for asking the questions that sharpened the physics issue, to the point that there was something worth writing. Then Bob Corbo of Simductive Golf got on my case about wrist position and acceleration at impact. He insisted that he and all his students had much more solid ball-striking and never an over-the-top if the wrist is flat or bowed from the transition through well past impact. He challenged me to explain why. It was clear it had something to do with acceleration. Appendix - More exact analysis Here is a more detailed analysis of the physics of impact. We are going to look at the equations for momentum transfer from clubhead to ball, and see how that is affected by an accelerating clubhead. If youre not into the math and physics of it, you can skip the details below. Heres a peek at the ending The distance gain you can expect from an accelerating clubhead is less than a foot -- only 8 inches. As in the simplified analyses, we will compare  case 1  clubhead impacts ball at constant speed of 100mph.  case 2  clubhead impacts ball at speed of 100mph, while accelerating at 500feetsecsec. These two cases will be compared, to test the value of clubhead acceleration in creating ball speed. Well start with notation. The computation will be done using MKS units meter-kilogram-second, to be sure we arent making mistakes in units. We will convert back to the units we recognize like pounds, miles per hour, etc when we want to get a feel for whats going on. U denotes a velocity just before impact. V denotes a velocity just after impact. Specifically U h  Clubhead speed just before impact  100mph  44.7 ms U b  Ball speed just before impact  0 V h  Clubhead speed just after impact we will compute V b  Ball speed just after impact we will compute M  Clubhead mass  200g  .2 Kg m  Ball mass  46g  .046 Kg mM  .046.2  0.23 Listed here because we use this ratio a lot C  Coefficient of restitution  .83 max allowed by USGARA CASE 1 - NO ACCELERATION OF CLUBHEAD INTO BALL This is a simple momentum transfer problem. The clubhead impacts the ball, and transfers some of its momentum to the ball. Since the clubhead is more than four times as heavy as the ball, it will still retain some considerable speed after impact -- though a lot less than before impact. The total momentum of clubhead plus ball remains the same after as it was before. And, of course, the total energy after impact will be less, because the COR is less than 1. Some energy will be lost to internal friction during the collision mostly friction inside the ball, but a little in the clubface. We will start with the well-known general equations for a simple lossy impact. V h  C m U b -U h   M U h  m U b Mm V b  C M U h -U b   M U h  m U b Mm But we know the ball starts at rest  U b  0, so we can simplify to V h  M U h - C m U h Mm  U h 1 - C mM 1  mM V b  C M U h  M U h Mm  U h 1  C 1  mM That last equation should look familiar we use it all the time to compute ball speed. The first equation is something we dont see as often it gives the clubhead velocity after impact. It will be slower, because the clubhead has transferred a bunch of momentum to the ball. If we use numerical values we originally assigned for m , M , and C , the equations become V h  U h 1 - .83  .23 1  .23  Uh  .66 V b  U h 1  .83 1  .23  Uh  1.49 Again, the second equation is familiar it is the maximum legal smash factor for a 200g driver head. It is generally thought of as 1.5, which is a very close rounding of 1.49. The first says that the clubhead loses about a third of its speed in impact. Now its easy to solve for Vb and Vh, the ball and clubhead speeds after impact V b  149 mph  66.6 ms V h  66 mph  29.5 ms So now we know how much the head slows down, and the ball speeds up, during impact. While were here, lets look at the force and momentum involved . Momentum is interesting to physicists at least in part because it relates force, time, velocity, and mass. Heres how Everybody knows Newtons second law F  ma One component of that is acceleration, which is a change of velocity over time. Physicists and mathematicians usually refer to such a change as a delta. So a change of velocity would be delta V or ΔV . So F  ma  m ΔV t Or Ft  m Δ V The right side is the change of momentum. The left side is called impulse, and the relationship is Impulse equals momentum change . Physicists and mathematicians have a more general view of impulse it does not require a constant force, as our equation does. But we prove below that, for our calculations, a constant force gives exactly the same answer as if we plotted the exact buildup and decay of force during the collision between clubhead and ball. Lets use this, plus our results above, to compute first the momentum change for clubhead and ball, then the force the clubhead exerts on the ball to cause the momentum change Clubhead  m Δ V  M U h - V h   .2 44.7-29.5  3.0 Ball  m Δ V  m Vb  .046  66.6  3.0 Good, theyre the same! That means we did the arithmetic right, because the law of conservation of momentum says any momentum gained by the ball must be lost by the clubhead. And it was. Now for the forces. From above, impulse  momentum change Ft  m Δ V We know that the momentum change is 3.0 Kg-meterssec, so Momentum change  Impulse  Ft  3.0 we also know that t  .0004, so .0004 F  3.0 F  7500 Newtons N  1686 pounds So the average force between clubhead and ball during impact is 1686 pounds. CASE 2 CLUBHEAD ACCELERATES INTO BALL In a good swing, the clubhead can accelerate into the ball by as much as 500 feet per second per second. In MKS units, thats 152.4 meters per second per second. The only reason clubhead acceleration might matter for distance is that there is an extra force added to the momentum transfer that we had in case 1. That force is whatever force is accelerating the clubhead. If it was accelerating the clubhead coming into impact, then it is continuing to push the clubhead during impact -- and that is where any benefit will derive. Lets use Fma to see how much force is accelerating the clubhead just before impact F  ma  .2  152.4  30.5 N  6.85 pounds This force will increase the momentum of the whole system during impact -- both the clubhead and the ball it is pushing. For the .0004 seconds that the clubhead and ball are in contact, we will have an extra 7 pounds of force well round 6.85 up accelerating the whole 246-gram mass of clubheadball. Lets see what that does to the final velocities. The calculations below are in MKS units. F t  M  m Δ V Δ V  F t M  m  30.5  .0004 .200  .046  .0496 ms  0.11mph So it has added a whole .11 mph to the combination of clubhead and ball by the time the ball separates from the clubhead. That means Clubhead speed after impact  66  .11  66.11 mph Ball speed after impact  149  .11  149.11 mph This is not much of a gain in yardage. Using the rule of thumb  1 additional mph of ball speed gives 2 additional yards , we have increased the distance by 0.22 yards, or about 8 inches. Why is this less than the rough calculations, the simplified analyses, in the main body of the article? Because each simplified analysis was a back of the envelope calculation that I could do in a couple of minutes. Any time you make a rough calculation instead of a complete analysis, you must make lots of assumptions. In each case, I had chosen an assumption to make acceleration look important. I did that because I suspected the answer would come out, Its not that important. I didnt want my assumptions challenged as the reason it didnt look important, so the assumptions were all in favor of acceleration. Note that, even so, acceleration didnt seem all that important. But when I replaced assumptions with actual calculation, the results showed acceleration to be even less important. DEPENDENCE ON FORCE PROFILE DURING IMPACT One last point These calculations are based on a constant force -- the average force -- during contact between clubhead and ball. One last point These calculations are based on a constant force -- the average force -- during contact between clubhead and ball. The blue force-vs-time profile in the picture shows this during impact, the force is some constant value, and it is zero all other times. Obviously this is contrary to fact the force starts small, increases as the ball compresses, and decreases as the ball releases and leaves the clubface. In other words, the red force-vs-time profile is what is really happening. So we need to show that it doesnt matter any force profile that gives the same average force will give the same final velocities. The same average force means the same area under the profile curve. Below is a quick proof, in case youre interested. It involves a bit of integral calculus, but very easy and basic stuff. The only place we make assumptions about the force profile is where we use impulse equals momentum change. So lets generalize that, using Ft for force as a function of time. That means we re-express F t  M Δ V as Ft dt  M dV where d means an infinitesimal delta. To find the actual change in velocity , we need to integrate.  Ft dt  M Δ V or , solving for Δ V  Δ V  1M   Ftdt Equation 1 Equation 1 gives the change in velocity if we used the actual force profile Ft  start small, increase to a peak, then fall off again. In order to compute Δ V directly from physical principles, we would need the actual force function Ft , and then use integration to find the area under the curve. But, in our calculations above, we used the average force over the duration of impact, F av . Is this legitimate? Does it give the same answer? To find out, we have to see how the average force F av is computed? If the total time is T in our case, 0.4 milliseconds, then the average is computed as F av  1T   Ftdt In our presumably exact analysis, we used F av to compute Δ V using the formula Δ V  F av  T  M Lets plug in for F av the time-dependent formula for F av using integration. So Δ V becomes Δ V  1T   Ftdt  T  M Δ V  1M  Ftdt Thats exactly the same as Equation 1 above. Which says we get the same change in ball speed whether we use the average force or the actual force profile. Last modified -- January 13, 2012","['Accelerating Through Impact Mandate or Myth Dave Tutelman -- January 7, 2012 Every golf instructor Ive ever read or heard says you must accelerate through impact . Then they extend this advice to mean that you will hit the ball farther -- more ball speed -- because you are accelerating the clubhead through the ball, than if you were simply coming into the ball at a constant clubhead speed. The first is good instruction. The second is not good physics. In January 2011, I visited Jim McLean at his headquarters school at Doral Miami, FL, and had a wide-ranging discussion with him and his staff about physics and golf. One of the more interesting topics was the question of clubhead acceleration at impact. It seems obvious to everybody who considers the question that an accelerating clubhead will hit the ball farther than a clubhead that is not accelerating. I have never heard or read any instruction that doubts the fundamental truth of this statement. But is it true? In this article, we are going to consider the questions Does ball go noticeably farther due to clubhead acceleration at impact? The answer will be no. So the next question is... Is accelerating through impact a good swing key anyway? Is it worth teaching as part of the fundamental swing? The answer will be yes. How much farther -- if at all -- will the ball go? If we are going to seriously consider the question, we have to state the premise less vaguely. We are going to compare Ball speed for a clubhead arriving at the ball at V miles per hour with no acceleration. Ball speed for a clubhead arriving at the ball at V miles per hour same clubhead speed with a positive acceleration of A . The question is how much faster if at all faster is case 2 ? Note that I did not ask, Is case 2 faster? I asked for numbers. Numbers matter! If it is only a fraction of a mile-per-hour faster then, for all practical purposes, there is no difference. It makes no sense to say, You get more distance by accelerating through the ball, if that extra distance is so small you cant even measure it reliably. However, if it is several miles-per-hour faster, that is a distance gain worth seeking. Brief digression on this point. Much of my writing on this site is aimed at custom clubfitters and clubmakers. I have seen so many clubmakers spend a lot of time optimizing one parameter while ignoring or giving short shrift to a different parameter -- one that matters a lot more. Why? Because they know how to measure and adjust -- sometimes with great precision -- the one they spend time on. Old proverb When all you have is a hammer, you tend to treat everything as a nail. This article is about instruction, not clubmaking, but we are investigating a similar phenomenon -- focusing on something that makes a tiny difference, perhaps at the expense of something else that is important. Simplified analysis 1 - Forces on the ball Lets use 100mph as the clubhead speed. I have done some computer simulations of good swings, and you might see an acceleration of almost 500 feet per second per second 500 ftss just before impact. Well use 500 ftss as the clubhead acceleration for case 2. Impact lasts 0.0004 second 0.4msec. During that time, the force the clubhead exerts on the ball averages about 1600 pounds. We need that much force in order to accelerate a 46-gram ball to 150mph in 0.4msec. For this analysis, we focus on the forces between the clubhead and the ball. The clubhead is a low-loft driver, so we dont have to worry about a glancing impact we can use the simple impact formulas. Case 1 If the clubhead is not accelerating at impact, that 1600 pounds is the force. Period! Case 2 If the clubhead is accelerating, then there is a force on the clubhead making it accelerate. Fma! We decided to use 500 ftss as the acceleration at impact. When we crank this into Fma along with 200g for the mass of the clubhead, we get a force of about 7 pounds accelerating the clubhead. Lets make the most generous assumption all the force of the clubheads momentum and all its accelerating force helps to accelerate the ball. So we have 1600 pounds due to the clubheads momentum. 1600 pounds due to the clubheads momentum. 7 pounds accelerating the clubhead. So the total force accelerating the ball is 716001607 pounds. How much larger is that than the force in case 1? The increase is 71600 .004 of the total force .4 That is less than half a percent. So the acceleration is worth less than an additional 12mph of clubhead speed, or an extra distance of less than 1.5 yards. Hardly worth concerning yourself with , unless you are a long drive competitor and pure yards are the way you keep score. Simplified analysis 2 - Clubhead speed Lets try another way of looking at it. What would the clubhead speed be immediately after impact , if the clubhead had not lost any momentum from impacting the ball? Why would this matter? If the ball were not there, we have a speed before impact and another one 0.4msec after impact i.e.- after separation. The clubhead speed that would be applied to the ball is somewhere between these two. So lets find both. Case 1 The clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. That is one of our original assumptions. Since Case 1 is the case of zero acceleration, the speed 0.4msec later is still 100mph. Case 2 Again, by assumption, the clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. We have an acceleration of 500 ftss. Therefore, in the duration of impact, the change of velocity is given by the acceleration times the time the acceleration is happening Change of velocity 0.0004sec 500 ftss 0.2 ftsec', 'an additional 12mph of clubhead speed, or an extra distance of less than 1.5 yards. Hardly worth concerning yourself with , unless you are a long drive competitor and pure yards are the way you keep score. Simplified analysis 2 - Clubhead speed Lets try another way of looking at it. What would the clubhead speed be immediately after impact , if the clubhead had not lost any momentum from impacting the ball? Why would this matter? If the ball were not there, we have a speed before impact and another one 0.4msec after impact i.e.- after separation. The clubhead speed that would be applied to the ball is somewhere between these two. So lets find both. Case 1 The clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. That is one of our original assumptions. Since Case 1 is the case of zero acceleration, the speed 0.4msec later is still 100mph. Case 2 Again, by assumption, the clubhead speed coming into impact is 100mph. We have an acceleration of 500 ftss. Therefore, in the duration of impact, the change of velocity is given by the acceleration times the time the acceleration is happening Change of velocity 0.0004sec 500 ftss 0.2 ftsec 0.14 mph Velocity 0.4msec after impact 100 0.14 100.14mph. So, out of a clubhead speed of 100mph, the acceleration gives us a boost of only 0.14mph. Thats only than a 0.14 gain, and represents an extra 15 inches of distance on the drive. Note that it is the upper bound of the gain in ball speed that you could expect the actual distance gain will be less. It is even less than Simplified Analysis 1 this one is probably negligible even for a long drive competitor. Not zero, true. But negligible. Bottom Line Our two back-of-the-envelope calculations show distance gains of no more than 4 feet and 1.3 feet respectively, and probably less than that. Thats feet, not yards. In the appendix, I have a more detailed analysis that comes closer to an exact answer -- and it is even lower than the two simplified analyses. It only shows 8 inches of additional distance. For comparison, lets look at just a few other things you might be working on instead of accelerating the clubhead Improve your wrist flexibility . Just one degree more of wrist cock is worth a yard and a half of extra distance. No, not a lot. But almost seven times what clubhead acceleration is worth. . Just one degree more of wrist cock is worth a yard and a half of extra distance. No, not a lot. But almost seven times what clubhead acceleration is worth. Get contact on the sweet spot .

With most drivers, missing the sweet spot a half-inch low on the face will cost ten yards. From my article on gear effect, and the HotStix data cited. Work on your core strength . An improvement of just 2 in the strength of your body rotation is worth two and a half yards. So physics does not back up the notion that accelerating through impact will increase distance. At least not by any amount that you would notice, or would do you any good. Certainly there are better things to worry about, if driving distance were the only benefit of accelerating through impact. Which brings us to our second question... Is it good instruction? We just found that it makes no sense to say, You get more distance by accelerating the clubhead through the ball, if that extra distance is so small you cant even measure it reliably. So why even mention it in instruction? Actually, I am in favor of teaching accelerating through the ball. But not because clubhead acceleration at impact will hit the ball farther. There are quite a few things that are bad physics but good instruction, and this is one of them. Lets look at some reasons that accelerating through impact is a good swing key. WHAT IS REALLY ACCELERATING? Is it the clubhead, as is usually assumed by teachers telling us to accelerate through impact? If not, is it the hands? The body? Lets look at the possibilities. Clubhead Weve already debunked the notion that you get more ball speed from an accelerating clubhead. But theres another reason not to try to accelerate the clubhead -- at least not unless you are doing it right . The act of trying to add clubhead acceleration may itself be deleterious to clubhead speed, if you do it in the obvious way. That seems like a non sequitur -- it doesnt follow. But lets review where clubhead acceleration can come from. Were doing physics here. The picture at the right shows the two ways the clubhead can still be accelerating at impact. One is good and the other not so good. Lets start out with the not-so-good one, the upper example. The wrists can be applying a torque to the handle, creating an accelerating force on the clubhead. The shaft must bend backwards to transmit the force. The reasoning is presented in my article on the right-hand hit. Most of that same article examines whether this sort of acceleration provides more clubhead speed or less. The conclusion is that, if applied with exquisite timing, strength, and hand speed, it might give a tiny bit more clubhead speed. But miss out on the timing, strength, or hand speed and it will cost far more distance than could possibly be gained by perfect application. So you dont want to accelerate the clubhead directly -- by forcing it with the hands and wrists. The lower example is a more productive way to apply clubhead acceleration through impact. The picture which I adapted from Andrew Rices web site shows the proper position at impact for an iron shot, as exemplified by an impact bag drill.', 'Were doing physics here.

The picture which I adapted from Andrew Rices web site shows the proper position at impact for an iron shot, as exemplified by an impact bag drill. You want the hands leading the clubhead. This implies that the wrist cock is not completely released at impact the green angle which I added to Andrews photo shows the wrist angle at impact. If you understand how centrifugal release works inertial release, if youre going to be a stickler about terminology, you will recognize that this position has the clubhead still accelerating the inertial release has not yet completed. I said this is more productive than accelerating the clubhead with wrist and hands. But why? There are a number of reasons. Go back to the examples in my article, particularly the strobe pictures drawn by the SwingPerfect program. You will note that using your hands and wrists to retain the lag as opposed to forcefully helping release the lag will actually increase clubhead speed. Also from the examples, note that a side effect is that the wrist cock is not completely released at impact. So -- lo and behold -- you do increase ball speed . But not because you are accelerating the clubhead at impact it is because you held off centrifugal acceleration until late in the downswing, where it creates the highest clubhead speed. With an iron shot, you want the hands to lead the clubhead for purposes of a solid strike and a negative angle of attack. This becomes less of an advantage with fairway woods and drivers the usual advice there is to sweep the ball rather than hitting down on it. But even with woods, you dont want to go beyond a flat wrist at impact. A cupped wrist is a bad idea the same physical argument says that the clubhead is decelerating if you do that. Which, of course, means that you missed the maximum clubhead speed, which occurred before the clubhead reached the ball. So there are good things that happen if you retain a bit of wrist cock at impact, especially with irons. One of the things that happens is that the clubhead is accelerating at impact -- but that is just a side effect, and doesnt really help you. Body The body turn involves angular velocity and acceleration, so accelerate through impact might refer to body rotation. In this category, I will lump together legs, hips, trunk -- all the way up to the shoulders. Thats because all have to be involved to move the shoulders. The muscles of every link in that chain must either create motion or trasmit it, up from the ground to the shoulders. What happens if the body does not accelerate through impact? Well, once the ball is gone, anything that happens makes no difference. So, theoretically, acceleration beyond impact is not going to matter. But thats theory, and someone once pointed out to me, The difference between theory and practice is bigger in practice than in theory. The problem with this theory is the difference between intent or even feel and what the body is actually doing. This relates very directly to accelerating the body turn through impact. A real live human being cannot accelerate the body to impact and not still be accelerating through impact . A golfer thinking only of accelerating to impact is going to quit accelerating before getting near impact. You cant turn off full-body acceleration in .4 milliseconds, probably not even in 100 milliseconds. intend to accelerate through impact . If there is any reason to want angular acceleration to continue fully to impact and we will see below that there are good reasons, then a good instructor will teach the golfer the intent of accelerating through impact. In fact, a good instructor will have the golfer exaggerate... Accelerate well beyond impact. If you have taken a lesson where your swing was videod, and watched the video afterwards, you know this is true. You may intend to make a particular exaggerated move, you may have felt that you made the move successfully, but it is barely there if at all on the video. Much of good golf instruction is getting people to greatly exaggerate a correct move, because it is the only way to get the motion to happen at all. So, assuming we want angular body acceleration to continue up to impact, the swing key to be taught is to accelerate well beyond impact. Hands and Arms I subscribe to golf instruction that says that the hands are moved by the body. But that is not the only theory of instruction out there I have read books that say things like, The arms do the swinging part of the golf swing... The body does not swing. It reacts to the swing. I may disagree with that, but it might be a productive intent and feel for some golfers. And that makes it valid instruction for those golfers. But', 'fact, a good instructor will have the golfer exaggerate... Accelerate well beyond impact.

I may disagree with that, but it might be a productive intent and feel for some golfers. And that makes it valid instruction for those golfers. But -- make no mistake about this -- physics says that hand and arm motion is caused by body rotation. That is actual, as opposed to intent and feel. So, if we are going to analyze the physics of the swing, the motion of the hands and arms is driven by the body rotation. For the first approximation, we do not have to analyze hands and arms separately, just the body rotation -- which we discussed above. If we were to refine the analysis, which I wont here, we would next account for the left arms separation from the body late in the downswing. Still nowhere near arms motivating the swing, but at least there may be some change of the result due to the rotation of the arm not being exactly the same as the rotation of the body. CONSEQUENCES OF ANGULAR DECELERATION Above we discussed the angular acceleration of the body. The argument above maintains that, unless you try to accelerate the bodys rotation well through impact, you will in fact lose acceleration well before impact. In golf terminology, you will quit on the shot. This has a number of consequences Distance actually is lost . This has nothing to do with the clubhead accelerating through the ball, but rather that less acceleration is applied to the clubhead for tens of milliseconds before impact. The clubhead is deprived of some of the accleration it would have had, in order to build up speed at impact. And clubhead speed at impact is what really matters for distance. The left wrist is cupped , rather than the proper flat or even bowed left wrist. We know that a bowed wrist at impact or a flat wrist at the very least is desirable for a solid hit. A cupped wrist, on the other hand, is associated with lost clubhead speed, fat or thin shots, or too-high balloon shots. It is also likely to point the clubface to the left, resulting in a pull or even a pull-hook. Think about it this way if the swing plane were perfectly vertical, then a cupped left wrist would add loft. Since the swing plane is not vertical but tilted, some of that loft turns into a left-facing angle. To demonstrate the points above, I ran more swing simulations with SwingPerfect. The way you maintain angular acceleration is to apply torque to the body to twist it. With a proper swing, this twists the entire assembly of body, shoulders, arms, and hands. SwingPerfect allows you to adjust the body torque over the course of the downswing -- not a very fine adjustment, but enough to see the effect of modifying the torque-vs-time curve. I ran three different swings for comparison. Here are the results. The model Torque variation during downswing Clubhead speed at impact Wrist angle at impact Constant accelerating torque through the downswing, no quit. The torque is 60 foot-pounds. For later reference, this is 6028016,800 foot-pound-milliseconds. 107 mph 3º bowed Our best approximation to the classic quit scenario The same 60 foot-pound of torque for the first 200msec of downswing. Then the torque drops to 40 foot-pounds for the last 80 msec. 99 mph 6º cupped Suppose, even with quit, we apply the same total torque-times-milliseconds to the swing as we did earlier to the constant-torque swing. Real swings dont work like that, but lets see how much of the effect is due to the total torque-seconds applied and how much to the fact that some torque is withdrawn late. A torque of 66 foot-pounds for the first 200msec. A torque of 46 foot-pounds for the last 80 msec. 66200 4680 16,880 foot-pound-milliseconds, almost exactly the same as the constant-torque swing. 104 mph 6º cupped This table confirms the consequences we guessed at above If you deprive the downswing of body torque by quitting on it, you lose clubhead speed -- and, obviously, distance. Not only that the torque late in the downswing the torque you lose when you quit is more important than torque early in the downswing. How do we know? Because we still lost 3mph of clubhead speed about 9 yards in the third calculation, where the total torque-seconds were the same as the no-quit swing the torque was larger early in the downswing and reduced during the quit at the end. Loss of body torque late in the downswing will indeed turn a bowed wrist good! into a cupped wrist bad! . Lets take one last look at the wrist cupping when the body turn quits coming into impact. Every instructor knows this is true! But the average golfer, and even the average instructor, might not understand why it must be true. Its not complex muscle interaction, its just physics and geometry. I set up a simulation with exaggerated quit', 'for the last 80 msec. 66200 4680 16,880 foot-pound-milliseconds, almost exactly the same as the constant-torque swing. 104 mph 6º cupped This table confirms the consequences we guessed at above If you deprive the downswing of body torque by quitting on it, you lose clubhead speed -- and, obviously, distance.

Every instructor knows this is true! But the average golfer, and even the average instructor, might not understand why it must be true. Its not complex muscle interaction, its just physics and geometry. I set up a simulation with exaggerated quit to illustrate it, using SwingPerfect. Look at the strobe swing animations here. The first animation maintains body torque through impact -- that is, it keeps accelerating the body rotation through impact. The clubhead starts with a lot of lag, and really gets moving develops a lot of momentum late in the downswing. The clubhead has just about caught up with the hands as it impacts the ball, giving a flat or slightly bowed wrist position at this position. The second animation starts out the same, and maintains acceleration for the first 200msec of the downswing. Then it gets seriously torque-deprived. That is what we mean by quitting on the swing we dont apply energetic body turn through the ball. Because were only human, the loss of acceleration takes effect before we get to the ball -- earlier than the quitter intended. You can see that the hands the red dots are slowing down late in the sequence the red dots are closer together, so we know they are getting slower. Meanwhile, the clubhead the gray dots has attained quite a bit of momentum, even after just 200msec. True, not as much as if we had continued to accelerate the rotation, but enough to catch and pass the hands as they slow down. At this point, its just geometry. The last tens of milliseconds before impact, the slowing hands and not-slowing clubhead result in a cupped wrist -- and all the evils that the cupped wrist brings. SHORT GAME IMPLICATIONS So far, we have been talking about a full swing. But there are two pretty obvious implications for the short game as well. I havent worked the numbers on this, but logic and plenty of anecdotal evidence seems to confirm it. Putting - In putting, the body turn becomes shoulder rock the swing plane is close to vertical. If you dont continue the shoulder rock well past impact, your wrist will cup. That tends to cause a pull. People who are wristy putters have learned to time the release to compensate for it. But it is hard to teach, and a low-percentage high-maintenance stroke. Now that we know this little gem of information, putting instruction has adopted a back-and-through motion with as steady a left wrist as possible. - In putting, the body turn becomes shoulder rock the swing plane is close to vertical.

Now that we know this little gem of information, putting instruction has adopted a back-and-through motion with as steady a left wrist as possible. Chipping and pitching - For these shots, wrist cock is negligible to nonexistent, so centrifugal acceleration isnt going to be a factor. What is left is Fma accelerating the clubhead through impact means that the hands, through the shaft, are applying a force to the clubhead. With a clean strike, the accelerating clubhead doesnt matter. But a slightly fat hit will take more than 50 off the distance of a chip or pitch, as opposed to maybe 10 or 20 from a full swing. That is because the clubhead is not just transferring momentum to the ball it is losing momentum to the ground before it even gets to the ball. When the clubhead strikes a ball, the only resistance is inertia. But the ground is adhered to the earth, and the earth is for all practical purposes an infinite mass. So the club has to administer enough force to cut some turf away from the earth. This is a lot more force than just moving a free-sitting golf ball. So a lot of the clubheads momentum is lost providing the force needed to cut the turf. What does this have to do with the accelerating force? Well, force applied to the clubhead can restore some of the lost momentum due to the fat hit. If it is seriously fat, then not much will be restored. But those slightly fat chips will get closer to where you want them if you are accelerating the clubhead all the way through the ball. Still, like putting or even the full swing, you dont want the hands to create the acceleration, just transmit it from the shoulders. Wristy chips and even pitches are lower-percentage shots. Unless they are perfectly timed, the usual problems of a cupped wrist are likely to occur fat hits and sculls. Think in terms of Steve Strickers motion he is one of the most reliable wedge players in golf. He sets the wrist angle, then uses his hands, wrists, and forearms to keep the angle.

The acceleration for the swing comes from the shoulders, and continues well through the ball. BOTTOM LINE Accelerate though the ball is an excellent swing key, for every shot from a drive to a putt. But it is better expressed as rotate your body through the ball or perhaps accelerate moving your hands beyond the ball, because it is body rotation or turning the triangle where acceleration through the ball is beneficial. Consciously accelerating the clubhead through the ball especially if you do it with the hands, wrists, or forearms will probably do more harm than good. Acknowledgements First off, Id like to thank Jim McLean for asking the questions that sharpened the physics issue, to the point that there was something worth writing. Then Bob Corbo of Simductive Golf got on my case about wrist position and acceleration at impact. He insisted that he and all his students had much more solid ball-striking and never an over-the-top if the wrist is flat or bowed from the transition through well past impact. He challenged me to explain why. It was clear it had something to do with acceleration. Appendix - More exact analysis Here is a more detailed analysis of the physics of impact. We are going to look at the equations for momentum transfer from clubhead to ball, and see how that is affected by an accelerating clubhead. If youre not into the math and physics of it, you can skip the details below. Heres a peek at the ending The distance gain you can expect from an accelerating clubhead is less than a foot -- only 8 inches. As in the simplified analyses, we will compare case 1 clubhead impacts ball at constant speed of 100mph. case 2 clubhead impacts ball at speed of 100mph, while accelerating at 500feetsecsec. These two cases will be compared, to test the value of clubhead acceleration in creating ball speed. Well start with notation. The computation will be done using MKS units meter-kilogram-second, to be sure we arent making mistakes in units. We will convert back to the units we recognize like pounds, miles per hour, etc when we want to get a feel for whats going on. U denotes a velocity just before impact. V denotes a velocity just after impact. Specifically U h Clubhead speed just before impact 100mph 44.7 ms U b Ball speed just before impact 0 V h Clubhead speed just after impact we will compute V b Ball speed just after impact we will compute M Clubhead mass 200g .2 Kg m Ball mass 46g .046 Kg mM .046.2 0.23 Listed here because we use this ratio a lot C Coefficient of restitution .83 max allowed by USGARA CASE 1 - NO ACCELERATION OF CLUBHEAD INTO BALL This is a simple momentum transfer problem. The clubhead impacts the ball, and transfers some of its momentum to the ball. Since the clubhead is more than four times as heavy as the ball, it will still retain some considerable speed after impact -- though a lot less than before impact. The total momentum of clubhead plus ball remains the same after as it was before. And, of course, the total energy after impact will be less, because the COR is less than 1. Some energy will be lost to internal friction during the collision mostly friction inside the ball, but a little in the clubface. We will start with the well-known general equations for a simple lossy impact. V h C m U b -U h M U h m U b Mm V b C M U h -U b M U h m U b Mm But we know the ball starts at rest U b 0, so we can simplify to V h M U h - C m U h Mm U h 1 - C mM 1 mM V b C M U h M U h Mm U h 1 C 1 mM That last equation should look familiar we use it all the time to compute ball speed. The first equation is something we dont see as often it gives the clubhead velocity after impact. It will be slower, because the clubhead has transferred a bunch of momentum to the ball. If we use numerical values we originally assigned for m , M , and C , the equations become V h U h 1 - .83 .23 1 .23 Uh .66 V b U h 1 .83 1 .23 Uh 1.49 Again, the second equation is familiar it is the maximum legal smash factor for a 200g driver head. It is generally thought of as 1.5, which is a very close rounding of 1.49. The first says that the clubhead loses about a third of its speed in impact. Now its', '-U b M U h m U b Mm But we know the ball starts at rest U b 0, so we can simplify to V h M U h - C m U h Mm U h 1 - C mM 1 mM V b C M U h M U h Mm U h 1 C 1 mM That last equation should look familiar we use it all the time to compute ball speed.

It is generally thought of as 1.5, which is a very close rounding of 1.49. The first says that the clubhead loses about a third of its speed in impact. Now its easy to solve for Vb and Vh, the ball and clubhead speeds after impact V b 149 mph 66.6 ms V h 66 mph 29.5 ms So now we know how much the head slows down, and the ball speeds up, during impact. While were here, lets look at the force and momentum involved . Momentum is interesting to physicists at least in part because it relates force, time, velocity, and mass. Heres how Everybody knows Newtons second law F ma One component of that is acceleration, which is a change of velocity over time. Physicists and mathematicians usually refer to such a change as a delta. So a change of velocity would be delta V or ΔV . So F ma m ΔV t Or Ft m Δ V The right side is the change of momentum. The left side is called impulse, and the relationship is Impulse equals momentum change . Physicists and mathematicians have a more general view of impulse it does not require a constant force, as our equation does. But we prove below that, for our calculations, a constant force gives exactly the same answer as if we plotted the exact buildup and decay of force during the collision between clubhead and ball. Lets use this, plus our results above, to compute first the momentum change for clubhead and ball, then the force the clubhead exerts on the ball to cause the momentum change Clubhead m Δ V M U h - V h .2 44.7-29.5 3.0 Ball m Δ V m Vb .046 66.6 3.0 Good, theyre the same! That means we did the arithmetic right, because the law of conservation of momentum says any momentum gained by the ball must be lost by the clubhead. And it was. Now for the forces. From above, impulse momentum change Ft m Δ V We know that the momentum change is 3.0 Kg-meterssec, so Momentum change Impulse Ft 3.0 we also know that t .0004, so .0004 F 3.0 F 7500 Newtons N 1686 pounds So the average force between clubhead and ball during impact is 1686 pounds. CASE 2 CLUBHEAD ACCELERATES INTO BALL In a good swing, the clubhead can accelerate into the ball by as much as 500 feet per second per second. In MKS units, thats 152.4 meters per second per second. The only reason clubhead acceleration might matter for distance is that there is an extra force added to the momentum transfer that we had in case 1. That force is whatever force is accelerating the clubhead. If it was accelerating the clubhead coming into impact, then it is continuing to push the clubhead during impact -- and that is where any benefit will derive. Lets use Fma to see how much force is accelerating the clubhead just before impact F ma .2 152.4 30.5 N 6.85 pounds This force will increase the momentum of the whole system during impact -- both the clubhead and the ball it is pushing. For the .0004 seconds that the clubhead and ball are in contact, we will have an extra 7 pounds of force well round 6.85 up accelerating the whole 246-gram mass of clubheadball. Lets see what that does to the final velocities. The calculations below are in MKS units. F t M m Δ V Δ V F t M m 30.5 .0004 .200 .046 .0496 ms 0.11mph So it has added a whole .11 mph to the combination of clubhead and ball by the time the ball separates from the clubhead. That means Clubhead speed after impact 66 .11 66.11 mph Ball speed after impact 149 .11 149.11 mph This is not much of a gain in yardage. Using the rule of thumb 1 additional mph of ball speed gives 2 additional yards , we have increased the distance by 0.22 yards, or about 8 inches. Why is this less than the rough calculations, the simplified analyses, in the main body of the article? Because each simplified analysis was a back of the envelope calculation that I could do in a couple of minutes. Any time you make a rough calculation instead of a complete analysis, you must make lots of assumptions. In each case, I had chosen an assumption to make acceleration look important. I did that because I suspected the answer would come out, Its not that important. I didnt want my assumptions challenged as the reason it didnt look important, so the assumptions were all in favor of acceleration. Note that, even so, acceleration didnt seem all that important. But when I replaced assumptions with actual calculation, the results showed acceleration to be even less important. DEPENDENCE ON FORCE PROFILE DURING IMPACT One last point These calculations are based on a constant force -- the average force -- during', 'speed after impact 149 .11 149.11 mph This is not much of a gain in yardage.

One last point These calculations are based on a constant force -- the average force -- during contact between clubhead and ball. The blue force-vs-time profile in the picture shows this during impact, the force is some constant value, and it is zero all other times. Obviously this is contrary to fact the force starts small, increases as the ball compresses, and decreases as the ball releases and leaves the clubface. In other words, the red force-vs-time profile is what is really happening. So we need to show that it doesnt matter any force profile that gives the same average force will give the same final velocities. The same average force means the same area under the profile curve. Below is a quick proof, in case youre interested. It involves a bit of integral calculus, but very easy and basic stuff. The only place we make assumptions about the force profile is where we use impulse equals momentum change. So lets generalize that, using Ft for force as a function of time. That means we re-express F t M Δ V as Ft dt M dV where d means an infinitesimal delta. To find the actual change in velocity , we need to integrate. Ft dt M Δ V or , solving for Δ V Δ V 1M Ftdt Equation 1 Equation 1 gives the change in velocity if we used the actual force profile Ft start small, increase to a peak, then fall off again. In order to compute Δ V directly from physical principles, we would need the actual force function Ft , and then use integration to find the area under the curve. But, in our calculations above, we used the average force over the duration of impact, F av . Is this legitimate? Does it give the same answer? To find out, we have to see how the average force F av is computed? If the total time is T in our case, 0.4 milliseconds, then the average is computed as F av 1T Ftdt In our presumably exact analysis, we used F av to compute Δ V using the formula Δ V F av T M Lets plug in for F av the time-dependent formula for F av using integration. So Δ V becomes Δ V 1T Ftdt T M Δ V 1M Ftdt Thats exactly the same as Equation 1 above. Which says we get the same change in ball speed whether we use the average force or the actual force profile.

Golf swing plane has always been one of the most difficult concepts to understand. There have been many books written on the subject, and it still confuses most golfers! The important point to remember is that you should swing on a plane that allows you to deliver the club consistently and repetitively to impact.

In this article we will cover the following:

What is Golf Swing Plane?

Simply stated, the golf swing plane is the angle and path your club travels as you swing back from address to the top of your backswing and then back through the ball. Since the length of your arms and the club are fixed your swing has a circular nature to it - in other words all golf swings are circular - and that circular motion occurs along an angled plane because the ball is on the ground next to you.

Golfers typically swing the club on a plane that lies between their shoulders and hips as shown in the below picture of Tiger Woods. A smaller angle with the ground indicates a flatter swing plane typical of a one plane golf swing that moves in the same plane back and through. A larger angle between your swing plane and the ground indicates a steeper swing plane which is typical of a two plane swing where the arms swing up onto a steeper plane at the top.

The golf swing moves both up and around. The less it moves up, and the more it moves around, the flatter your swing plane. If your arms swing around and stay on the same plane as your shoulder tilt at the top then you are a one-planer. The more up you swing on a steeper plane, the less around you swing. If your arms swing up and onto a steeper plane than your shoulders at the top then you are a two-planer. There have been equally great golfers who have employed the two different swings. The most famous one-planer is Ben Hogan. Ernie Els has a classic one plane motion while Tom Watson has a classic two plane swing.

Why is Swing Plane Important?

The below points highlights why finding the right technique and improving your swing plane is so important to becoming a better, more consistent ball striker - the goal of most golfers!

More consistent shot direction

Tighter shot dispersion

More consistent solid contact

Fewer thin and fat shots

Fewer dramatic hooks and slices

Both one plane and two plane swings can create power and accuracy. In general, the one plane swing is good for players that have strong flexibility and recoil. A two plane swing is good for players that may not be as flexible but have timing and rhythm. Many top modern golfers have migrated towards one plane swings due to their specialized golf strength and flexibility. Many top instructors advocate for a one plane motion as being able to produce more consistent distance and accuracy.

One Plane Swing

What is a one-plane golf swing? The one-plane swing is flatter and works around your body and your lead arm remains on the same plane as your shoulders at the top. Strong rotation from your shoulders, chest and hips, and maintaining your posture are the keys to a one-plane swing. The set-up for a one plane swing generally has more spine angle with the golfer being bent over around 35 degrees with even weight distribution on each foot. During the backswing your shoulders turn on a steeper angle than your hips because you are bent over more. Your lead arm feels very connected to your chest as your turn back. You rotate your upper body around against the brace of your trail leg, keeping your spine centered, and being sure not to sway.

As the club reaches parallel with the ground on your takeaway the clubface should be square to your spine angle and pointed slightly towards the ground. At the top of the swing your arms should be on the same plane as your shoulders and the angle of your shoulders should be pointed down on a line that runs just past the golf ball. A good drill is to put a driver on the ground outside of the ball and perpendicular to your target line and imagine your shoulders pointing inside the head of the driver. To start the downswing rotate your hips and torso with your arms following in a more passive role. Remember the downswing plane is the same as the backswing plane so just return the club the way you brought it back paying particular attention to keep your spine and shoulders on the same tilted plane. At the finish your trail shoulder has rotated through and is pointed at the target and your arms and hands have rotated around to be above your lead shoulder.

Pros of a One Plane Swing

The positives of a one-plane swing are generally thought to be as follows.

Simpler and more repeatable

Fewer moving parts

Arms and shoulders working together

Arms and shoulders work on the same plane

Cons of a One Plane Swing

The cons of a one-plane swing are generally thought to be as follows.

More flexibility is required

More athleticism is required to stay in your posture

The ball launches too low for some players

Some players catch the heel at impact (might need to adjust your club’s lie angle)

Two Plane Swing

What is a two-plane golf swing? The two-plane swing is steeper and characterized by the lead arm swinging up to be more upright than the shoulders at the top of the swing. The set-up for a two plane swing has less spine angle with the golfer generally bent over around 20 degrees with slightly more weight on their back foot. Oftentimes the two plane swing has the ball positioned closer to the body to encourage a more upright turn and the spine tilts back so the shoulders are positioned slightly back of center instead of a more centered set-up in the one plane swing. During the backswing your shoulders turn on a flatter plane closer to the rotation in your hip plane but your arms swing up. The two plane backswing is more timing dependent than the one plane swing because if your shoulders turn too fast your arms can stray to the inside instead and you need to lift them to get to the top.

A couple good thoughts for the two plane swinger are to think about keeping your arms in front of your body as they swing up, and to be sure to rotate your hips to clear some space. You can even lift your front heel to help your turn. All of these things will help compensate for less flexibility. Think back to the driver drill discussed earlier. At the top of a two plane swing your shoulders will not be tilted down as much as in a one plane swing, and they should point out past the head of the driver on the ground. The downswing begins with a slight forward bump of your hips while your shoulders remain passive. This helps your arms separate from the shoulders and drop into the proper plane on the way down. Many players feel like they keep their back to the target for a beat longer to help them drop their arms into a great position before rotating them back to the ball. At the finish the two plane golfer does not rotate their shoulders through as much as the one plane and typically finishes with their chest facing the target.

Pros of a Two Plane Swing

The positives of a two-plane swing are generally thought to be as follows.

Easier to generate more distance for most golfers

Don’t need as much flexibility to execute

More shot variety

More feel based

Cons of a Two Plane Swing

The negatives of a two-plane swing are generally thought to be as follows.

Need good timing and tempo to be consistent

More power but less control for many golfers

Takes more time to maintain a two plane swing

Spine Angle and Swing Plane

Your spine angle at set-up determines your swing plane. Having more bend in your posture encourages a flatter, one-plane swing while standing taller encourages a more upright two-plane swing. Regardless of what type of swing you choose, you should practice the set-up until it becomes second nature. If you adjust your set-up to help produce a different swing plane it can potentially throw off your alignment, so practicing it becomes that much more important. Maintaining your spine angle throughout your swing is critical, and rehearsing it to develop the muscle memory to execute consistently on the golf course is essential. An important aspect of a proper golf swing plane is maintaining your spine tilt as you rotate, which means your arms and torso need to be strongly connected for a one plane swing, and well synchronized for a two plane swing. Seeking the help of a professional instructor or using a golf plane aid like the Swing Align are great ways to understand and improve your swing plane.

Practice Swing Plane Using Swing Align

Swing Align adds a visual indicator to every part of your golf swing, it allows you to see body positions that you wouldn’t be able to otherwise, and can be a huge help in finding your proper golf swing plane.

An easy check you can do while wearing a Swing Align is to, at the top of your swing, look at the position of the rod across your chest. Ideally you want to see the front end of the alignment rod pointing slightly downward, toward the ground. This indicates that you have maintained the proper spine angle and you are on the proper swing plane.

If the front of the rod is angled up in the air, you have failed to maintain your posture during your backswing which changes your swing plane.

https://www.golfdistillery.com/tweaks/swing/club-path/,Modify your Swing (Club) Path to Shape your Golf Shots,"The way the golf club crosses the target line at impact – as well as before and after – is defined as the swing path and it can vary across three different types.

They are explained below.

Inside-Square-Inside Swing Path

The inside-square-inside swing path is fundamentally a straight swing path as it naturally follows the restrictions set by your body as it is positioned relative to the ball.

Indeed, during the takeaway and backswing, the clubhead will naturally be brought inside the target line so that it can rotate around the central axis of your body.

During the downswing your body will uncoil and the club will follow a similar path until it will reach the ball at impact and intersect with the target line for the only time in the entire swing.

Finally, after impact the club will be brought back inside the target line as it continues following its natural path around your body.

Promotes Straight Shots

Provided that your clubhead strikes the ball in a square position relative to the target – perpendicular to the target line – an inside-square-inside swing path will deliver a straight shot at the target.

Actually, a square swing path is the only way a ball can fly to the target without the help of any sidespin.

Impacts of Clubface Position on Ball Flight

An inside-square-inside swing path will only create a straight shot with minimal sidespin if the clubface hits the ball in a square position.

A closed clubface will produce a hook – right to left sidespin – while an open clubface will produce a slice – left to right sidespin.

Related Golf Swing Thought:

Outside-In Swing Path

The outside-in swing path will see the clubhead move outside of the target line right after address, during the takeaway and backswing.

It will cross that line at impact and follow its course inside during the follow through.

Basically, this is a type of swing path that is aimed left of the target. It is also often referred to as an over the top.

Promotes Left-to-Right Side Spin (Fades & Slices)

Such a swing path is closely associated with slices as the club cuts the ball at impact. Indeed, depending on how the clubface is positioned at impact left to right side spin will naturally be transferred onto the ball.

Impacts of Clubface Position on Ball Flight

If the angle of the clubface matches the angle of the swing path at impact then the ball will shoot straight forward.

However, because an outside-in swing will be aimed to the left of the target, this combination of factors will produce a pulled shot, i.e., a straight shot to the left of the target.

If the angle of the clubface is closed (aimed to the left) relative to the target line but open relative to the swing path then you will likely produce a shot that will fade towards the target.

Finally, if the angle of the clubface is open relative to the target line and open still to the swing path then you will likely produce a shot that will slice away from the target.

Related Golf Swing Thought:

Inside-Out Swing Path

The inside-out swing path will see the clubhead move inside of the target line right after address, during the takeaway and backswing.

However, it will have been brought too far inside, which will result in the clubhead crossing the target line at impact and continuing outside of it during the first stages of the follow through, rather than be brought back inside.

Basically, this is a type of swing path that is aimed right of the target.

Promotes Right-to-Left Side Spin (Draws & Hooks)

Such a swing path is closely associated with hooks as the club will cut the ball at impact. Indeed, depending on how the clubface is positioned at impact right to left spin will naturally be transferred onto the ball.

Impacts of Clubface Position on Ball Flight

If the angle of the clubface matches the angle of the swing path at impact then the ball will shoot straight forward.

However, because the inside-out swing will be aimed to the right of the target, this combination of factors will produce a pushed shot, i.e., a straight shot to the right of the target.

If the angle of the club is close to the swing path but open to the target line then you will likely produce a shot that will draw towards the target.

Finally, if the angle of the clubface is closed relative to the target line and open still relative to the swing path then you will likely produce a shot that will hook away from the target.

They are explained below. Inside-Square-Inside Swing Path The inside-square-inside swing path is fundamentally a straight swing path as it naturally follows the restrictions set by your body as it is positioned relative to the ball. Indeed, during the takeaway and backswing, the clubhead will naturally be brought inside the target line so that it can rotate around the central axis of your body. During the downswing your body will uncoil and the club will follow a similar path until it will reach the ball at impact and intersect with the target line for the only time in the entire swing. Finally, after impact the club will be brought back inside the target line as it continues following its natural path around your body. Promotes Straight Shots Provided that your clubhead strikes the ball in a square position relative to the target  perpendicular to the target line  an inside-square-inside swing path will deliver a straight shot at the target. Actually, a square swing path is the only way a ball can fly to the target without the help of any sidespin. Impacts of Clubface Position on Ball Flight An inside-square-inside swing path will only create a straight shot with minimal sidespin if the clubface hits the ball in a square position. A closed clubface will produce a hook  right to left sidespin  while an open clubface will produce a slice  left to right sidespin. Related Golf Swing Thought Outside-In Swing Path The outside-in swing path will see the clubhead move outside of the target line right after address, during the takeaway and backswing. It will cross that line at impact and follow its course inside during the follow through. Basically, this is a type of swing path that is aimed left of the target. It is also often referred to as an over the top. Promotes Left-to-Right Side Spin Fades  Slices Such a swing path is closely associated with slices as the club cuts the ball at impact. Indeed, depending on how the clubface is positioned at impact left to right side spin will naturally be transferred onto the ball. Impacts of Clubface Position on Ball Flight If the angle of the clubface matches the angle of the swing path at impact then the ball will shoot straight forward. However, because an outside-in swing will be aimed to the left of the target, this combination of factors will produce a pulled shot, i.e., a straight shot to the left of the target. If the angle of the clubface is closed aimed to the left relative to the target line but open relative to the swing path then you will likely produce a shot that will fade towards the target. Finally, if the angle of the clubface is open relative to the target line and open still to the swing path then you will likely produce a shot that will slice away from the target. Related Golf Swing Thought Inside-Out Swing Path The inside-out swing path will see the clubhead move inside of the target line right after address, during the takeaway and backswing. However, it will have been brought too far inside, which will result in the clubhead crossing the target line at impact and continuing outside of it during the first stages of the follow through, rather than be brought back inside. Basically, this is a type of swing path that is aimed right of the target. Promotes Right-to-Left Side Spin Draws  Hooks Such a swing path is closely associated with hooks as the club will cut the ball at impact. Indeed, depending on how the clubface is positioned at impact right to left spin will naturally be transferred onto the ball. Impacts of Clubface Position on Ball Flight If the angle of the clubface matches the angle of the swing path at impact then the ball will shoot straight forward. However, because the inside-out swing will be aimed to the right of the target, this combination of factors will produce a pushed shot, i.e., a straight shot to the right of the target. If the angle of the club is close to the swing path but open to the target line then you will likely produce a shot that will draw towards the target. Finally, if the angle of the clubface is closed relative to the target line and open still relative to the swing path then you will likely produce a shot that will hook away from the target.
