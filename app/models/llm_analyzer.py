## Swing Analysis Summary

Based on the video analysis, here are some observations about your swing:

### Setup Phase
- Your stance appears slightly wider than shoulder-width, which can provide good stability
- Your posture shows a good spine angle, though you could bend slightly more from the hips
- The ball position looks appropriate for the club you're using

### Backswing
- Your takeaway is smooth with good tempo
- Your wrist hinge develops appropriately in the backswing
- Your right elbow could be kept a bit closer to your body for better consistency

### Downswing
- Good weight transfer from back foot to front foot during the transition
- Your hips are rotating well through impact
- The swing plane looks consistent throughout the downswing

### Impact
- Club face alignment at impact appears slightly open
- Your head position is stable through impact
- The club path is on a good line toward the target

### Follow Through
- Good balance maintained through the finish
- Full extension of arms after impact
- Complete rotation of the body toward the target

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Club Face Control**: The slightly open club face at impact suggests you may be prone to slicing the ball. Focus on maintaining a square club face through impact.

2. **Right Elbow Position**: Keeping your right elbow closer to your body during the backswing will help create a more consistent swing plane.

3. **Hip Rotation**: While your hip rotation is good, increasing the speed of rotation could generate more power in your swing.

4. **Wrist Release**: Your wrist release could be more active through impact to generate additional club head speed.

These adjustments should help improve both consistency and distance in your swing.
